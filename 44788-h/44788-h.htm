<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>WHAT THE POSTMAN BROUGHT</small></h2>


<p>The shrill vibration of the postman’s whistle
brought Bob Baker to the front door on the run.</p>

<p>“Only a postal!” he exclaimed as the mail-man
handed it to him. “It’s for me though. Wonder
what it is?”</p>

<p>He turned it over and glanced at what seemed
to be only a printed form with, here and there, a
word written in.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” mused Bob.</p>

<p>Carefully he went through the lines of printing
and writing. They resolved themselves into a
notice that at the freight station of the Atlantic
&amp; Northern Railroad there was a piece of merchandise
shipped from the International Gas Engine
Company, which article could be had on
application to the freight agent.</p>

<p>“It’s our motor boat!” exclaimed Bob. “It’s
come! Hurrah! I must hurry over and tell Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and Jerry! Whoop! I’m glad it’s Saturday.
We can put in the whole day getting the boat from
the station. Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter, Bob?” asked Mrs.
Baker, coming to the head of the stairs and looking
at her son, who, at that instant was standing
on his head in the lower hall.</p>

<p>“Matter? I should say there was, mother!”
he cried, jumping to an upright position. “Our
motor boat’s here!”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Baker. “Now I
suppose you’ll be going off on cruises which will
be worse than the automobile trips.”</p>

<p>“Worse? Better you mean, mother,” remarked
Bob. “But I must run over to Ned’s
house. Where’s my hat?”</p>

<p>“Where did you leave it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the boy, who seldom
could keep track of the head covering. “Never
mind, it’s warm, I’ll go without it.”</p>

<p>He ran from the house into the pleasant spring
sunshine, and soon was racing down the street
toward the home of one of his chums, Ned Slade.
Reaching there he gave a shrill whistle on his
fingers.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned, poking his head out
of a window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s here!” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>“What! Our boat?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Just got a postal from the freight
office. Come on, we’ll get Jerry and have the
boat taken to the river. Shiver my timbers, I can
hardly wait! Hurry up, Ned!”</p>

<p>Ned needed no urging, and soon the two boys
were at Jerry Hopkins’ house. He was not home,
but his mother told his chums where they could
find him, and they started off to a neighbor’s
house, where Jerry had gone on an errand.</p>

<p>The three boys had gone into partnership in
the purchase of a motor boat. They lived in
Cresville, Mass. Bob Baker was the son of a rich
banker, while Ned Slade’s father was the proprietor
of a large department store. Jerry Hopkins
was the son of a well-to-do widow.</p>

<p>The lads had been chums for a number of years,
and had been closely associated in a series of
adventures which began with the purchase of motor
cycles and which were destined to be continued
with the acquisition of the motor boat.</p>

<p>As told in the first volume of this series, “The
Motor Boys,” the three took part in some bicycle
races under the auspices of the Cresville Athletic
Club. They won, but in doing so incurred the
enmity of Noddy Nixon, a town bully, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wealth had made him a spoiled son. One of the
chums won a motor cycle as a prize and, soon after
this the other boys also discarded their bicycles for
the more rapid vehicles.</p>

<p>They had many adventures on the motor cycles,
in some of which Noddy Nixon played a prominent,
if a mean part. The boys entered a motor
cycle race and were successful, winning the
first prize, a big automobile touring car. Because
of a robbery at a local mill Noddy Nixon had to
flee from Cresville, running off one night in his
father’s automobile.</p>

<p>In the second book, “The Motor Boys Overland,”
I told of how Ned, Bob and Jerry started
west. They had many exciting adventures, being
put to considerable trouble by Noddy, who heard
of their trip and followed them. The motor
boys got permission from their folks to search for
an old mine which a prospector whom they befriended
told them of. They found the mine
with the help of Jim Nestor, and secured possession,
though they had a close race with Nixon, and
two of his cronies, Jack Pender and also Bill
Berry, a Cresville ne’er-do-well.</p>

<p>The mine proved to be a rich one, and the shares
the boys received were considerable. They arranged
to have Jim Nestor work the claim for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them, as he was the largest shareholder, because
of having known of the mine previously.</p>

<p>But the finding of the mine did not end the
adventures of the motor boys. They had picked
up on their trip west an old professor, Uriah Snodgrass,
who had heard of a buried city in Mexico.
The boys resolved to start for that country and
got permission to go.</p>

<p>On the way many things occurred, as related in
the third book of the series, “The Motor Boys
in Mexico.” They had fights with Mexicans, and
their old enemy Noddy Nixon turned up to bother
them. There were fights with wild animals and
reptiles, and by a plot between Noddy and some
rascally Mexicans, Bob was captured, but later got
away.</p>

<p>The buried city was found most unexpectedly
by the auto sinking through the earth upon a concealed
passageway. There were strange happenings
in the long-lost city, and the professor discovered
a valuable box of jewels.</p>

<p>The young travelers then resolved to make a
trip across the prairies and in the fourth book of
the series, called “The Motor Boys Across the
Plains,” I told of their exciting journey. An old
hermit was found who proved to be the father of a
boy that the three chums rescued from a desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gang. Later the hermit was of much assistance
to the motor boys, since the gang was trying to
get possession of the mine. The hermit was one
of the original owners of the claim, and through
him the mine was kept in the power of the boys
and Nestor. The claim was found to be paying
better than ever; and, after defeating the gang
that sought to get it, the motor boys came home,
having been away a long time.</p>

<p>Their parents, no less than their friends and
relatives in Cresville, were glad to see them, and
it took the lads several days to tell of their adventures.
The mine, the possession of which was
kept in a sort of company formed by the boys,
their parents and Jim Nestor, paid well, and it was
with some of the proceeds that the boys bought a
motor boat.</p>

<p>They still kept their automobile, but as they
had arrived home in the fall, and as the winter,
which soon came, was an unusually severe one,
they had little chance to go out in the touring car.</p>

<p>They had resumed their studies, all three of
them attending the Cresville Academy. It was
now the close of May and in another month they
would finish the term.</p>

<p>Ned and Bob hurried to where Mrs. Hopkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had said Jerry could be found. He was just leaving
to come home.</p>

<p>“Hey!” called Bob, catching sight of him.
“The boat’s come, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Got a postal! Come on to the freight
yard!”</p>

<p>The boys, whose spirits were bubbling over with
excitement ran, rather than walked, to the freight
house. They went up the platform steps by jumps
and burst in on the agent, who was busy over waybills.</p>

<p>“Where is it, Mr. Hitter?” gasped Bob.</p>

<p>“Where’s what?” asked Mr. Hitter, peering
over the tops of his glasses.</p>

<p>“Why our motor boat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ about no motor boats,”
said the agent, preparing to go on with his work.</p>

<p>The hearts of the boys began to sink. Suppose
the boat had been lost in shipment?</p>

<p>“But this postal says it has arrived,” persisted
Bob showing what the letter carrier had given
him.</p>

<p>“Oh that,” said Mr. Hitter. “Well, yes, there
is a piece of freight as big as a house addressed
to you. But I didn’t s’pose it was a boat. I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
it for a specimen of a whale that I thought Professor
Snodgrass had ketched while you an’ him was
down in Mexico. It’s boxed up jest like a whale.
I’ll bet it is a whale, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” cried the boys in chorus.</p>

<p>“Down at th’ t’other end of th’ platform. But
look out it don’t bite ye! I’ll bet it’s a shark if
’tain’t a whale,” and Mr. Hitter chuckled heartily.</p>

<p>The boys raced down the platform. At the
end, where it had just been taken from a flat car,
was a long box, measuring about twenty-seven by
ten, by seven feet. Indeed it did look as if it contained
the remains of some prehistoric monster.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! This is it!” cried Ned, as he read
from a paper pasted on the big box:</p>

<p class="noic">“<i>One motor boat. This side up with care.</i>”</p>

<p>“Get a hammer and we’ll unpack it!” cried
Bob. “Where’s an axe?”</p>

<p>“Now ye’d better go slow, boys,” cautioned
Mr. Hitter, coming up at this juncture. “Was
ye calalatin’ to sail right here from th’ depot down
th’ main street?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I forgot you have to have water
for a boat,” spoke Bob, wiping the perspiration
from his forehead, for he was quite fat, and the
excitement made him warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to make haste slowly, Chunky,”
said Ned, applying to him the nick-name Bob’s
chums sometimes used.</p>

<p>“How are we going to get it home?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Can’t ye carry it on yer shoulders?” asked
Mr. Hitter with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it weighs a ton,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“Nearer two, accordin’ t’ th’ way bill,” chimed
in the freight agent. “Now I tell ye what t’ do.
Leave it right in th’ box. Go off an’ git Hen
Jaegers, who’s got th’ biggest truck in town t’ cart
it t’ the river for ye. Then ye won’t damage it.
Jest come in an’ sign the receipt an’ let Hen do
th’ rest. If ye carried it yerselves ye might
drop it, an’ damage the spark plug or whatever it
is makes it go,” and he laughed again at his joke.</p>

<p>The boys decided this would be the best to do.
Bob, to whom the boat was consigned, put his
signature to the receipt, and then the lads hurried
to the office of the truckman.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can try it to-night?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Guess so,” put in Ned. “I’ve been reading
the catalog and directions until I know ’em by
heart.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember when we first got the motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cycles and how one got going and we couldn’t
stop it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure. And when we first got the auto,”
chimed in Bob.</p>

<p>“That reminds me of something I almost forgot,”
spoke Jerry. “Did you hear the news?”</p>

<p>“What news?” came from Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“About Noddy Nixon. He’s coming back.
His father has fixed everything up, I understand.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Ned. “Well,
he’s got nerve after what he did to us, trying to
rob us of the mine and putting those Mexicans up
to kidnap Bob. I’d like to give him a good
threshing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’ll make trouble for us,” said Bob.
“I’ll be worried about our motor boat all the
while it’s on the river, as long as Noddy Nixon
is in town.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, he’ll not interfere with us any
more,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m no calamity howler,” put in Bob,
“but I’ll bet we are going to have more trouble
with Noddy.”</p>

<p>And after events showed that Bob had guessed
rightly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE MOTOR BOAT</small></h2>


<p>The boys found Mr. Jaeger so busy hauling all
sorts of freight and merchandise from the depot
and other parts of Cresville that he could not
promise to go after the boat that day.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Jaeger,” said Bob. “We’ve
got to have that boat on the river to-night or we’ll
lose all our sleep, and it will be your fault. We’ll
come and stand under your window after dark and
sing.”</p>

<p>“Oh my! Oh my!” exclaimed the truckman,
throwing up his hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, we will!” insisted Bob. “We’ll sing
‘The Solder’s Farewell’ and ‘My Bonnie Lies
over the Ocean’ if you don’t get that boat for us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t threaten any more!” cried Mr. Jaeger.
“I’ll haul the boat for you if I have to disappoint
every customer I’ve got. Only don’t sing. I can’t
stand it. Never could,” and he laughed. Then
he called his assistant and gave orders to have the
boat taken from the freight station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite a job, for the boat was encased in
a heavy box to prevent breakage, but eventually it
was loaded upon the wagon. The boys climbed
upon the truck and rode along, fearful to let the
precious boat get out of their sight.</p>

<p>It was about a mile to the river and all along
the way many persons stared at the big load, wondering
what the motor boys were up to now, since
their adventures were known all over Cresville.
As the truck was passing Mr. Nixon’s house Jerry
nudged Bob.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Chunky.</p>

<p>“There’s Noddy.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the barn. He was just looking out. There
he is now.”</p>

<p>Bob caught sight of Noddy’s head as he quickly
dodged out of sight.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Bob, “we’ll be on the
lookout for him after this.”</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon did not seem to care to be seen
by the motor boys. As it developed, after the
part he had played in the capture of Bob and in
inducing the gang of Mexicans, Bill Berry and
others to follow on the trail of the searchers after
the lost city, the young rascal had kept pretty well
under cover. But, being tired of a roving life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and keeping so far away from home Noddy had
written to his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Nixon had called on Mr. Baker, and had
humbly apologized for Noddy’s actions, promising
to see that his son did no more mischief. On
these conditions, of which Mr. Baker said nothing
to his son or the other boys, Noddy was allowed
to come home, it being agreed that he would not
be prosecuted for his crimes. He had reached
his house that very day, though the rumor of his
coming had preceded him.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the arrival of the motor boat
the boys had built a float and dock on the edge
of the river fronting on a piece of land belonging
to Mr. Baker. This plot adjoined one owned by
Mr. Nixon, who had a small boathouse where
were kept a rowboat and a small sailing craft.</p>

<p>The boys had hired a carpenter to erect for
them a good sized shelter where their motor boat
might be kept, but it was not quite finished. The
big box was soon unloaded and opened.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she just a dandy!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“A regular beauty!” exploded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Finest thing in the country!” came from Bob,
his desire to eat now forgotten. “It’s worth every
cent we paid for it. I only hope it will go all
right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course it will go,” answered Ned. “I
wonder if we have any gasolene?”</p>

<p>“I sent some down last night on the chance
that she would come to-day,” said Jerry. “Now
to launch the <i>Dartaway</i>!”</p>

<p>“The <i>Dartaway</i>? Is that her name?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Jerry. “I forgot to tell you
when I wrote out the order that I told the manufacturers
to give her that name. If you don’t
like it, we can change it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine name,” came from Ned, and
Bob said it suited him.</p>

<p>The boat was twenty-five feet long and about
six feet beam. The engine was a four cylinder
one, with all the latest improvements, arranged
with three speeds forward and a reverse just
as an automobile is, and the craft also steered
with a bright colored wheel in the front, similar
to a touring car.</p>

<p>There was a little cockpit forward where there
was room for six to sit comfortably and leave a
place for the steersman. The engineer had a little
place partitioned off for himself, and amidships
were roomy lockers and an arrangement where a
table could be set.</p>

<p>There was even a small galley with a stove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which burned gasolene, and food could be cooked
on board. There was a camping outfit of dishes
and kitchen utensils, and the lockers could be
made into fairly comfortable bunks in case one
wanted to sleep on board.</p>

<p>There was a portable awning that could be put
up to cover the whole of the craft and side curtains
that could be fastened shut. The one in
front was fitted with a celluloid window so that
in stormy weather the boat could be worked and
steered under shelter. Also, if the occupants desired
they could pass a night on board and keep
dry in the hardest rain.</p>

<p>A whistle worked by the exhaust of the gasolene
explosions, a search lamp, similar to those
on automobiles, a small anchor, a regular ship’s
compass, flags and a kit of repair tools, with some
extra parts of the engine, completed the boat’s
equipment.</p>

<p>The truckmen, no less interested than the boys,
surveyed the <i>Dartaway</i>. It was indeed a fine boat
and the motor boys might well be proud of her.
There was nothing like her on the river. She
looked speedy, as if the name fitted her.</p>

<p>“Now to get her into the water,” said Ned.
“How are we going to do it? I never launched
a boat before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll show ye,” spoke the truck driver. “Come
on men,” and he motioned to his helpers.</p>

<p>They passed a heavy rope about the cradle, and
ran one end of it to a windlass under the front
seat of the big wagon. The vehicle had been
backed down on the dock. The driver next placed
some rollers under the bottom of the cradle, and
the craft was soon in the water.</p>

<p>By bow and stern lines the craft was made fast
to the float. Then the boys jumped in. The boat
rocked gently to and fro. It bobbed up and down
slightly and swung with the current of the river.</p>

<p>“Oh! This is something like!” cried Bob as
he grasped the steering wheel, and gave it a few
turns.</p>

<p>“That’s like you, taking the easy part the first
thing!” exclaimed Ned. “Why don’t you crank
up the engine?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use, there’s no gasolene,” came
from Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon remedy that,” replied Jerry, as he
hurried into the boathouse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>AN ACCIDENT</small></h2>


<p>Jerry came back with a large can and a funnel.
With the help of the boys he filled the tank in
the forward part of the boat.</p>

<p>“Now we’re ready to go,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” came from Ned, who had been
reading a card of instructions that was attached
to the engine. “This says it is best to let the boat
rest in the water a few hours after launching to
swell the seams before starting the engine, as they
might strain open.”</p>

<p>“Oh I’m so glad you discovered that,” Bob
said. “We might have gone out and been sunk!
Let’s go to dinner first.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what you were thinking of all
the while instead of any danger,” retorted Ned.
“But I guess it’s just as well to let the boat rest
a bit. Besides, we’ll have to oil the engine good
before starting it.”</p>

<p>“Will we leave the boat here alone and all go
to dinner?” asked Ned. “I think one of us ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to stay on guard. Bob can stay until you and I
come back, Jerry,” and he winked the eye concealed
from Chunky.</p>

<p>“Oh I say, fellows!” cried Bob. “I don’t
believe any one will touch the boat.”</p>

<p>His friends burst out laughing at the woe-begone
expression on his face, and the manner in
which Bob placed his hands over the region of his
stomach.</p>

<p>“I guess one of the carpenters will watch the
<i>Dartaway</i> until we come back,” suggested Jerry,
and the man who had the contract for the boat
house agreed. He did not go home to dinner.</p>

<p>Bob seemed to hesitate on emerging from the
dining room after the meal. Ned noticed it and
asked:</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have enough of that chicken,
Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” replied Bob with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Then what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking we might get stuck out in the
river aboard the boat,” said the fleshy youth.</p>

<p>“Why you’re not afraid, are you? You can
swim.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not exactly afraid of that.”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Why I was thinking if we got stuck, you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
there’s nothing aboard to eat, and&mdash;and&mdash;we
might be hungry&mdash;so I was thinking&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“Well, what?” as Bob hesitated.</p>

<p>“We might take some of those chicken sandwiches
along, if your mother didn’t object.
They’d come in handy.”</p>

<p>“Well of all things!” gasped Ned. “I believe
you’d take a lunch along if you were going
to a banquet, for fear you’d be hungry on the
road. Go ahead, Chunky. Take all you want
of the sandwiches. Here’s a bag,” and he ran
to the kitchen and came back with a flour sack.</p>

<p>Bob gravely emptied the plate and also put
some pieces of cake and a few pickles into the
sack. Then carefully tying it up he followed the
others from the room.</p>

<p>It was agreed that Jerry, from having made a
more careful study of the machinery than either
of the others, should act as engineer on the initial
trip. Accordingly Bob and Ned drew lots to see
who should steer, and the choice fell to Ned.</p>

<p>With the carpenters watching them curiously
the boys climbed aboard and prepared to start.
Jerry looked over the machinery, adjusted the
valves, saw that the wires leading from the batteries
to the cylinder spark plugs were all right,
and cranked up. Though the fly wheel was heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it turned easily because well adjusted and oiled.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We’re off!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Jerry. “I haven’t thrown in
the clutch yet. You forget this is a new style of
boat.”</p>

<p>Letting the engine run a few minutes to warm
up Jerry went over it all carefully and applied
oil where it seemed to need it. He watched the
feed cups on the cylinders and saw that they were
working properly.</p>

<p>“I guess we can start off on the low gear,”
he announced as he grasped the lever and advanced
the spark a trifle to make the explosions come more
rapidly.</p>

<p>The screw began to revolve and, at the stern
of the <i>Dartaway</i> there came a swirl of foam as
the blades beat the water.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Bob. “This is something
like! It’s got an automobile beat a mile!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything against automobiles,” cautioned
Jerry. “Ours stood by us well.”</p>

<p>“So it did,” agreed Bob. “But this is simply
immense!”</p>

<p>Up the river they went, and about a mile from
the float they passed a rowboat containing two
boys and two girls.</p>

<p><em>Toot! Toot! Toot!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>A shrill whistle sent a blast out as Ned pulled
the cord which operated it. The occupants of the
rowboat looked up and waved their hands.</p>

<p>“Give us a ride!” they cried.</p>

<p>“It’s Andy Rush, Sam Morton, Alice Vines
and Mollie Horton,” said Ned. “Shall we take
’em in, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the reply. “I’ll slow down. Steer
over toward ’em.”</p>

<p>The speed was lessened and Ned threw the
wheel around until the <i>Dartaway</i> was headed toward
the small craft.</p>

<p>“Look out! Don’t run us down! We’ll upset&mdash;I
can’t swim&mdash;save the girls&mdash;don’t blow
up the engine&mdash;throw us a life preserver&mdash;back
water&mdash;back pedal&mdash;put on brakes!” cried one
of the boys.</p>

<p>“Oh Andy Rush, you’re enough to give any
one a headache!” exclaimed Alice Vines. “No
wonder your name is Rush!”</p>

<p>“Stop rowing and we’ll come alongside. Pull
in the oars!” cried Jerry, and Ned skillfully put
the <i>Dartaway</i> close to the smaller boat. While
Bob steadied it against the motor craft the occupants
got into the cockpit.</p>

<p>“Shall we tow your boat?” asked Jerry, “or
leave it tied up on shore?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better tow it,” said Sam, “we hired it for
the afternoon and have to return it.”</p>

<p>So the rowboat was fastened to the stern of the
<i>Dartaway</i> and Jerry started the motor up again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this lovely!” exclaimed Mollie Horton.
“Where did you ever get such a beautiful boat?”</p>

<p>“It’s a perfect dream!” came from Alice.</p>

<p>“You bet!” put in Andy. “Nightmare when
you smell the gasolene&mdash;whoop! Crank her up&mdash;don’t
explode&mdash;get mad&mdash;say all sorts of
things&mdash;turn off the batteries&mdash;throw on the
magneto&mdash;test the spark plugs&mdash;get a shock&mdash;get
madder&mdash;then all of a sudden&mdash;off you go&mdash;whoop!”</p>

<p>“It’s the same old Andy,” said Jerry with a
smile.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try her on full speed now,” said
Jerry, when after several miles the boat was turned
around. He threw the lever over as far as it
would go and advanced the spark lever to the end
of the rachet.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> sprang forward almost as if
alive. The water fairly boiled under the stern
and she shot down the river at top speed. The
engine was purring, throbbing and humming as
the explosions came faster and warmed the cylinders
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is something like going!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a snap as if something had
broken and with a cough and wheeze the engine
came to a stop. Jerry sprang forward and shut
off the gasolene to avoid flooding the cylinders with
it. Then he threw out the clutch.</p>

<p>“Oh! Has something happened?” cried Alice.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is it an accident?” asked Mollie, turning
pale. “Are we in danger?”</p>

<p>“It’s an accident, but I don’t believe we are in
danger,” spoke Jerry. “We can get ashore at
the worst. Just sit quietly until I make an investigation.”</p>

<p>The boat was drifting slowly on the current.
Then it seemed to hit something and stop.</p>

<p>“We’re on the sand bar!” Ned cried. “I forgot
it was right here.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A QUEER KIND OF RAT</small></h2>


<p>“Oh, this is terrible!” cried Alice. “I’m
going to jump out!”</p>

<p>“Put us ashore! We’ll sink!” screamed Mollie.</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Jerry sternly. “You
girls are old enough to know better. There’s no
danger, even if the boat has broken down, and
we are stuck fast. If worst comes to worst we
can row you ashore. Now, if you’ll keep quiet,
I’ll see what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>As Ned had guessed, they were on a sand bar.
The boat had been moving quite swiftly before the
accident happened, and, what with the momentum
and the drift of the current, had run well up on
the obstruction.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Jerry when matters had
quieted down somewhat, “I guess the first thing
to do is to look and see what the trouble is with
the motor.”</p>

<p>With the assistance of Ned and Bob, Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
tested the engine to see if there was good compression,
that is if there was the proper mixture of air
with the vapor from the gasolene to produce the
explosive gas which made the piston move. He
found that there was no trouble from this source.</p>

<p>“How’s the spark?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I haven’t tried that yet,” said Jerry. “I will
now.”</p>

<p>He detached one of the wires connected with
the batteries and magneto or small dynamo from
the binding post of one of the cylinder heads and
adjusting the contact breaker, touched the end to
the set screw. There was no answering spurt of
greenish flame.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” said Ned. “No spark.
Wire must be broken.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if it’s the faults of the batteries or
the magneto,” spoke Bob, who was inclined to go
slow.</p>

<p>By means of a small handle on the armature of
the magneto it was whirled rapidly around. As
soon as this was done there came a vicious spark
from the end of the wire.</p>

<p>“Trouble is in the batteries,” said Ned.</p>

<p>The spark which exploded the gases in the cylinders
of the <i>Dartaway</i> was produced in two ways.
When the engine was first started it came from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
series of dry cells and a spark coil. Once the fly
wheel was revolving well, a switch could be turned
to make the current come from the magneto, which
was operated by it. But it was necessary that the
fly wheel revolve swiftly before any current sufficient
to operate the motor would be produced
by the magneto.</p>

<p>Now the only way the fly wheel could be operated
swiftly enough was to run the engine rapidly
and this could not be done except by a spark from
the batteries. So it will be seen that the motor
boys were in trouble of a peculiar kind right at
the start.</p>

<p>True, if one of them could have turned the fly
wheel swiftly enough by hand to have made the
magneto produce a spark, to get the explosions
started the problem would have been solved, but
it is doubtful if even a strong man could have performed
that feat.</p>

<p>They tried it by turns, when Jerry had exhausted
everything else he thought of, but for all
their back-breaking efforts there was no result.
The <i>Dartaway</i> belied its name.</p>

<p>The boys were hot and tired. The girls were
nervous. It had been Jerry’s plan to get the
engine started, reverse the screw, and see if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
could not pull the boat from the bar. But she
stuck fast.</p>

<p>“Shall we row the girls ashore?” asked
Sammy. “It’s getting late and the folks may be
worried.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re sorry to lose your company,” said
Jerry, “but we seem to be up against it. Maybe
it would be the best thing to do. We’ll make up
for this some day and give you all a better ride.”</p>

<p>The girls got up, preparing to leave.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a fine pickle!” exclaimed Sammy.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” cried Alice.</p>

<p>“Our rowboat’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Our boat?” asked Andy, shortening his remarks
for another time.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” came from Sammy.
“The rope got untied. She’s floated off. I guess
you’ll have to entertain us a little longer, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Make yourselves comfortable,” said the engineer
of the <i>Dartaway</i>. “I’m going to find out
what’s the trouble before I go home. We’ll get
you back some time.”</p>

<p>“I hope it’s soon,” murmured Alice. “It will
be dark in a little while.”</p>

<p>Spurred on by the plight of their guests the
motor boys redoubled their efforts to discover the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
cause of the trouble and remedy it. That it was
in the wires leading from the batteries to the cylinders
was certain, but the conductors, when examined
as far as possible, showed no sign of
break.</p>

<p>“I’ll just have to run new wires, temporary
ones of course,” said Jerry after a while. “It
will take a little time, but it’s bound to do the
trick.”</p>

<p>He overhauled the stores and extra parts in
one of the lockers. “I hope we have a coil of
wire,” he muttered. “I’m certain I saw some.”</p>

<p>But his search did not reveal any. The situation
was getting serious. Already the sun was
behind the trees, and the girls plainly showed their
nervousness.</p>

<p>“Let Sammy and me get out, take the rope and
try to pull the boat off the bar,” suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“It’s too risky,” said Ned. “This bottom is
of the quick-sand variety, and you’d sink down.
I guess we’re stuck here until the motor goes.”</p>

<p>Bob was rummaging about under one of the
seats. He hauled out a package, exclaiming as
he did so:</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>“What, the wire?” asked Jerry excitedly.</p>

<p>“No, that lunch I brought along! I’m glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it’s here. I’m hungry and I guess the rest of you
can nibble at a chicken sandwich or two.”</p>

<p>“Can we?&mdash;well I guess yes!” cried Andy,
and the others chimed in with him. Even Jerry,
though much worried over the mishap, stopped
tinkering with the engine long enough to munch
some of the food.</p>

<p>“Call me all the names you want to,” said
Chunky with a grin, “but you’ll have to admit
I’m there with the goods.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Chunky!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Alice suddenly. “Something bit
me on the foot! I believe it’s a rat! Oh dear!
Save me!”</p>

<p>She jumped up, much excited, Mollie following
her example.</p>

<p>“Sit still!” cried Jerry. “There are no rats
aboard!”</p>

<p>“But something bit me!” insisted the girl.
“It had sharp teeth and I felt them in my ankle.
I have low shoes on!”</p>

<p>She moved away from where she had been
sitting. Mollie retreated toward the stern. Jerry
got a lantern and lighted it, for it was now dusk,
and dark down in the cockpit where the girls had
been resting. He made a careful examination.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“What, the rat?” asked Alice.</p>

<p>“No; I’ve found the broken wire that caused
all our trouble,” came from Jerry. “It was the
end of it sticking up through a crack and touching
you on the ankle that you felt. Now we’ll
be off!”</p>

<p>It was indeed the break in the copper conductor
that he had discovered. The ends of the wire came
up through a space in the flooring of the boat.
They ran from a compartment in the forecastle
back to the motor. In less than a minute Jerry
had twisted the broken ends together. Then he
fastened the conductor back in the spark plug.
Turning on the gasolene he gave the fly wheel a
twist.</p>

<p>There came a welcome chug-chug and then a
throb of the motor. Jerry threw in the reverse
gear. The water at the stern was churned into
foam as the screw revolved. Slowly the <i>Dartaway</i>
backed off the sand bar and into a deeper channel.
Then Jerry threw in the forward speed and the
craft shot ahead.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the boys. “We’re off!”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky you discovered that rat,” said Jerry
to Alice, “or we might have stayed there all
night.”</p>

<p>Bob lighted the search lamp, as it had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
quite dark, and the shaft of glaring whiteness
shone on the black river. Jerry speeded up the
boat, and it went down the stream toward Cresville
at a rapid pace.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>PLANNING A CRUISE</small></h2>


<p>Ned was steering, and, having passed two or
three large craft he put the boat over to the Cresville
side of the river, to gain the advantage of the
better current. He was peering ahead into the
darkness, lighted up by the slender pencil of fire
from the search lantern, when he suddenly made
an explanation, and threw the steering-wheel over
so quickly that the <i>Dartaway</i> careened to one side.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned. “Slow her down,
Jerry! There’s a boat ahead!”</p>

<p>Before Jerry could do this, however, the motor
boat rushed past some dark object in the water.
There was a crash and splintering of wood, and
the occupants of the <i>Dartaway</i> dimly saw a man
crouching in the bottom of a small boat as they
rushed past.</p>

<p>“We only smashed one of his oars,” said Ned,
as he turned the wheel back to avoid running the
craft into the bank. “I just saw him in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
He wasn’t making a sound or I might have heard
him. He should have shown a light.”</p>

<p>“Could you see who it was?” asked Bob, between
bites at a chicken sandwich, for he had again
attacked the lunch.</p>

<p>“Probably a lone fisherman after eels,” responded
the steersman.</p>

<p>By this time the <i>Dartaway</i> was approaching
Cresville, the lights of the town being visible.</p>

<p>The girls and boys from the rowboat were
landed at the main dock and the motor boys
started back for their own shelter.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we did much damage to that boat
we hit,” mused Bob. “Whose was it any way?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you whose it was, but I think it
was the one the girls were out in, and which floated
away from us,” said Ned. “But I can tell you
who was in it.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Jerry sharply.</p>

<p>“Bill Berry!” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Positive. I had a good glimpse of him just
before I swung the wheel over. I’d know him
anywhere. We have good reason to. I’d know
him and Noddy Nixon, his bosom friend, wherever
I met them.”</p>

<p>“Bill Berry, eh,” said Jerry softly. “Well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
if he and Noddy are in town together it means
that some mischief is afoot. They never get together
but something happens. We’ll have to be
on our guard. They may try to pay us back for
getting ahead of them as we did on several occasions.
I wonder if Bill and Noddy have met
since Noddy came home.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he was doing in that
boat, if it was the one that floated away from us?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He was probably hanging around near the
river bank and saw it when it floated down,” said
Ned. “He thought it was a chance to earn
money by selling it or by returning it to the dock,
and he just got in it.”</p>

<p>A little later the boys had housed their boat
and started for home.</p>

<p>“We ought to go off on a cruise somewhere,”
suggested Ned. “It would be a fine thing to
go down the river to Lake Cantoga, and spend
three or four days camping there. We could hunt
and fish and have a bully time.”</p>

<p>“Say, that would be sport!” agreed Bob.
“We could take along a lot to eat in case the fish
didn’t bite or we didn’t kill anything.”</p>

<p>“Say, Chunky,” spoke Jerry solemnly, “if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mention eating again to-night, after the way you
devoured chicken sandwiches to-day, I&mdash;I’ll hit
you, that’s what!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Bob with a little sigh,
“I guess I was born hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well if you weren’t, you certainly have acquired
the habit since,” observed Ned dryly. “But
that aside, what do you think of my plan, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Nothing better, only I guess we’ll have to
wait until the term closes. I don’t want to flunk
in my exams, and I guess you don’t, either of you.
I’m a little bit shaky on my algebra, and my
Latin is none of the best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course we’ll wait until the academy
closes,” agreed Ned. “That will only be three
weeks now. In the meantime we can take short
trips and get acquainted with our boat. If there
are as many kinds of trouble that can happen as
are down in the book, we will no more than have
learned how to remedy them by the time we want
to start.”</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, the boys went down to
the dock for a look at the <i>Dartaway</i>. As they
approached they saw some one peering through a
side window into the house where the boat floated.</p>

<p>“Some one is nosing around,” observed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>As they came closer the person did not move
away, evidently not hearing their footsteps, as the
wind was blowing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon!” cried Bob, as the person
turned with a start.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>AN ENCOUNTER WITH NODDY</small></h2>


<p>At first it seemed as if Noddy was about to run
away, like a child surprised in some mischief. But
he saw that he could not escape without going
past the motor boys, unless, indeed, he jumped into
the river and swam across. So he decided to
bluff it out. He turned aside and appeared to
be gazing into the stream as the three comrades
approached.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” whispered Bob. “Speak
to him or not notice him?”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said Jerry. “I’ll see what
he has been up to.”</p>

<p>Noddy stooped and picked up several stones
which he idly tossed into the water.</p>

<p>“When did you get back?” asked Jerry, trying
to speak politely to his old enemy.</p>

<p>“None of your business!” retorted Noddy.
“And what’s more, if I find any of you fellers
has been tellin’ tales about me I’ll make you smart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for it! I’ll sue you for damages! I don’t want
to have anything to do with you!”</p>

<p>“I guess that feeling is as much on our side as
it is on yours,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” chimed in Jerry. “And what’s
more, Noddy Nixon, if you feel that way about it
you’d better get off this dock. It’s private property
and we don’t allow any but our friends to
come here and see our motor boat. You’re a trespasser
and the sooner you move on the better we’ll
like it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go when I get good and ready!” fired
back Noddy. “I came here because I have a claim
against you, and I want it settled now or you’ll be
the worse for it!”</p>

<p>“A claim against us?” asked Jerry. “What
sort of a claim? Has it anything to do with the
old mine that you didn’t get?”</p>

<p>“You think you’re mighty smart!” exclaimed
Noddy, flushing as he thought of how the motor
boys had outwitted him. “This is a claim I have
against you for smashing one of my rowboats last
night.”</p>

<p>“Your rowboat!” exclaimed Ned. “Since
when have you owned any rowboats?”</p>

<p>“There’s the bill for damages,” spoke Noddy,
handing over a piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys examined it curiously. It was a billhead
on which was set forth that Noddy Nixon
had succeeded to the business formerly conducted
by James Lawrence of hiring out boats at Cresville.
The bill was made out to the three chums,
jointly and called for the payment of fifteen dollars
for damage done to a rowboat.</p>

<p>“So you’ve been set up in business by your
father, eh?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“My father has nothing to do with this. I’m
my own boss,” snapped Noddy.</p>

<p>“Must have made the deal quite suddenly,”
commented Ned. “Lawrence owned the business
up to two nights ago, for I hired a boat from him
then.”</p>

<p>“The deal was closed last night,” Noddy condescended
to explain. “The boat Andy Rush
and Sammy Morton hired and took the girls out in
was the first one I let and you had to go and run
it down in your old motor boat. It was a piece of
spite work and you’ll have to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Noddy Nixon!” exclaimed Ned.
“You’ve got a lot of nerve to charge fifteen dollars
for the little damage we did to your boat. It
was an old one anyhow, for I know all Lawrence’s
craft and he hasn’t a new one in the place. Besides
I was steering and I saw what damage we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
did. We smashed an oar, and we’re willing to pay
for that, or get you a new one.”</p>

<p>“You smashed my boat, and you’ll pay for it or
go to jail!” fairly shouted Noddy.</p>

<p>“I can prove that we only broke an oar!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“How you going to do it?” asked Noddy in
sneering tones. “It was a dark night, and I have
the broken boat to show what damage was done.”</p>

<p>“If necessary we’ll fight this case,” spoke Ned
quietly, “and we’ll call some one as a witness who
can tell just how much the boat was damaged, for
he was in it at the time.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” inquired Noddy, with a start.</p>

<p>“Your old pal Bill Berry! Bill may not relish
being put on the witness stand, but he’ll have to
go if you insist on pressing this bill.”</p>

<p>Noddy turned pale.</p>

<p>“Bill Berry isn’t within a hundred miles of
here,” he said faintly.</p>

<p>“Maybe he skipped out of town over night,”
spoke Ned, “but he was in that boat last night.
Don’t try any more of your tricks on us, Noddy,
or it may go hard with you!”</p>

<p>Ned crumpled up the bill into a ball and threw
it at Noddy. He did not intend to do it, but the
wad of paper struck the bully in the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll pay you for that!” cried Noddy.</p>

<p>He sprang at Ned, who was so surprised at the
result of his thoughtless act that he did not know
what to do. Noddy’s fist shot out and struck
Ned in the face.</p>

<p>With the instinct every boy has, when he is hit,
to strike back, Ned doubled up his fists and assumed
the attitude approved in the roped arena.
Noddy’s rush had carried him past Ned, but the
bully, enraged at the failure of his plans, came
back with a jump straight at his antagonist. It
looked as if there would be a fistic encounter that
peaceful Sunday.</p>

<p>“Don’t fight him now!” cried Jerry rushing
between the two. “Let it go, Ned. We don’t
want any trouble with the blackguard. We can
settle with him later!”</p>

<p>Deciding to obey his friend’s advice Ned
dropped his arms and stepped to one side. Noddy
was close upon him and, when Ned got out of the
way so quickly the bully could not stop in time.
Ned was standing near the edge of the dock, and,
meeting with no resistance in his mad rush Noddy
fairly flew over the string-piece and landed in the
water with a resounding splash. He disappeared
from sight as the river was quite deep there.</p>

<p>“Get a rope!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Throw him a life preserver!” yelled Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a boat hook!” exclaimed Ned, racing
toward where the <i>Dartaway</i> was kept.</p>

<p>By this time Noddy had come to the surface.
He was spluttering and gasping, for his sudden
bath had caught him unawares and his mouth and
nose were filled with water. He floundered
around, handicapped by his clothes, and did not
seem to know what to do.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to spring into the water when
he was suddenly halted by hearing some one exclaim
in a high pitched, sing-song voice:</p>

<p>“Never mind my lad, jumping after him. He’s
a regular duck, and surely can swim!”</p>

<p>The boys turned to behold a shabbily dressed
though pleasant faced man sauntering down on
the dock.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t Pete Bumps!” cried Bob, recognizing
the odd character who used to work for his
father, but who now did odd jobs about the town.
“Can he really swim, Pete?”</p>

<p>“Swims like a feather in all kinds of weather,”
replied Pete, one of his peculiarities being to talk
in rhyme.</p>

<p>Noddy, seeing there was no likelihood now of
any one coming in after him began to strike out
for shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll give him a hand to reach the land,” recited
Pete, and, taking a boat hook, which Bob
had by this time found, Pete proceeded to stick
the end into Noddy’s coat, just back of his neck.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone!” snapped Noddy, between
gasps.</p>

<p>But Pete was not to be cheated of his rescue.
He got a firm grip with the hook on Noddy’s
clothing and then, walking along the side of the
dock, towed the bully ashore. In the excess of
his zeal, Pete moved him so fast that half the time
Noddy’s head was under water, and he was in no
amiable frame of mind when he staggered ashore,
the water dripping from his Sunday suit.</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll have the law on you for this!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“What? Because you took a notion to jump
into the river?” asked Ned. “I guess it would
be a queer jury that would award you anything.
Will you come into the boat house and dry off?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go in your boat house for a hundred
dollars!” cried Noddy. “But I’ll get even
with you!”</p>

<p>“He’s rather mad, for such a wet lad, but never
mind that, I’ve got his hat,” said Pete, and, with
a skillful motion he speared Noddy’s head-covering
with the boat hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you spoil that hat!” cried Noddy.</p>

<p>“Now Noddy don’t you worry, though I was in
a hurry. It only has a little tear, it’s better than
before to wear, because it lets in lots of air,” sung
Pete, inspecting the hat, which had a small hole in
it.</p>

<p>Noddy walked up on the dock, the water sloshing
from his shoes at every step. He picked up
his wet hat, jammed it down on his head, and, with
an angry look at the other boys started off. As he
did so a figure burst through the bushes and ran
toward the group on the dock. At first the boys
thought it was a tramp. They looked closely at
the man.</p>

<p>“Why it’s Bill Berry!” exclaimed Jerry. “I
thought you said he was a hundred miles from
here, Noddy.”</p>

<p>“You old fool you, what did you want to come
around for?” snarled Noddy at his notorious
chum.</p>

<p>“I thought they were going to drown you, and
I decided to take a hand and give them a walloping,”
said Berry sullenly. “I owe them something
on my own account.”</p>

<p>He advanced threateningly toward the motor
boys.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>TO THE RESCUE</small></h2>


<p>Bill Berry was a big burly fellow, pretty much
of a brute in his ways, and, though the boys knew
he was a coward at heart, they realized that he
might prove an ugly customer in a fight. He
could not be depended on to battle fairly, but
would take any advantage that came his way. Nor
would he hesitate to use a stick or stone, where
others would rely on the weapons which nature
had given them; their fists.</p>

<p>“We’d better get ready for trouble,” said Jerry
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Shall we tackle him?” asked Ned. “He
and Noddy will be no more than a match for the
three of us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fight if we can avoid it,” counseled
Jerry.</p>

<p>Bill Berry, with anger in his eyes continued to
advance. Noddy, who had started to go away,
came back, emboldened by the attitude of his
crony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to get my hands on you
fresh lads for some time!” exclaimed Bill. “Now
I’ve got a chance.”</p>

<p>“You might have stopped off last night, just
before we ran you down,” said Jerry. “We could
have accommodated you then.”</p>

<p>“Was that you, last night?” asked Bill, suddenly.
“Did you see me? Did you see the
Blue&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then Bill seemed to remember that he was
talking too much. He came to a sudden stop, and
looked over at Noddy, who was detected in the
act of shaking his fist at his former ally.</p>

<p>“We didn’t see anything blue, green or red,”
put in Ned. “It was too dark to see anything
but you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ll pay for what you did!” exclaimed
Berry. “I’ll have the law on you for
smashing my boat!”</p>

<p>“So Noddy has said,” came from Bob. “It’s
getting to be an old story.”</p>

<p>“See here, you young whelps!” cried Bill in
sudden anger. “I’ll show you what it means
to make fun of me!”</p>

<p>He made a sudden dash toward the three boys,
who stood close to the edge of the dock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stand ready!” spoke Jerry in low tones. “If
he tries any of his tricks you two jump to one side
and I’ll tackle him. If he gets the best of me,
you can jump in and lend a hand.”</p>

<p>Bill, with clenched fists, sprang at the three
boys. Bob and Ned moved a little to one side to
give Jerry plenty of room. It looked as if there
was going to be trouble.</p>

<p>“List to the song of the whip-poor-will. He
threw in the river poor old Bill!” came in sing-song
tones from the rear. There was a sudden
rush. Two figures mingled on the dock. There
was a struggle, a smothered exclamation, and then
a mighty splash in the water.</p>

<p>“There he goes, over his toes!” cried old Pete
Bumps, jumping excitedly about.</p>

<p>Below the dock Bill Berry was struggling in the
water. He spluttered and threshed about and
then struck out for shore.</p>

<p>“Quite a little swim, while the evening light
grows dim,” recited Pete solemnly.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Pete!” cried Ned. “You
came in the nick of time!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Pete anxiously. “I
was afraid I’d be a little late. However I saw he
meant business so I sailed in. I couldn’t have him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
fighting you boys Sunday night, so I just thought
a little bath would cool him off. I took hold of
him and&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“He fell in, that’s all,” finished Ned. “You’re
all right, Pete.”</p>

<p>Bill reached shore and he and Noddy slunk
away.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re well rid of them,” observed Jerry.
“I’m glad we didn’t get to fighting, though I
wouldn’t run away from it if it had to be. Pete
did us a good turn.”</p>

<p>“I’m always on hand to beat the band,” put
in the odd character. “To be with you boys fills
me with joys. That ain’t a very good rhyme, but
I’ve been making a lot of ’em to-day, and I’m kind
’a tired,” he added.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better go home and go to bed,
Pete,” advised Bob. “It will do you good.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, I’m on my way,” replied the
old man solemnly, as he turned to go.</p>

<p>“Did anything strike you as peculiar?” asked
Jerry of his chums.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I mean the way Bill Berry acted,” replied
Jerry. “He seemed to fear we had discovered
something. Then there was his remark about
something blue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know, that occurred to me,” put in
Bob. “But I didn’t like to say anything for fear
you’d laugh at me. It seemed as if he was afraid
we had discovered something.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I took it,” spoke Ned. “I
wonder what it could have been.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it was, you can depend on it there
was something crooked back of it,” commented
Jerry. “Those two never got together but they
were up to some mischief. I only hope we have
no further trouble with them.”</p>

<p>The boys were again at the boat house the next
afternoon. Ned had asked to run the engine, and,
as it was decided that all three should take turns
at managing the different parts, Bob went to the
wheel while Jerry played he was a passenger.</p>

<p>“Down or up?” asked Bob, as he threw in
the clutch and backed the <i>Dartaway</i> out of the
house.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down,” suggested Jerry. “Then
we can try her up against the current and see how
she behaves.”</p>

<p>The boat was making good progress, the engine
was purring like a contented cat, and the boys were
beginning to enjoy the run, when Bob suddenly shut
off the power and cried:</p>

<p>“There, I forgot all about ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” asked Jerry anxiously. “There’s
plenty of gasolene, I hope.”</p>

<p>“It’s the sandwiches,” spoke Bob in sorrowful
tones. “I told our girl to put up a lot of ’em so
we could have ’em this afternoon in case we got
stuck again. Now I’ve come off without ’em. I
guess I’ll go back.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind!” exclaimed
Jerry. “This is no picnic party. We’re not going
to get stuck. If we do we’ll make you wade
ashore and get the grub. You’re captain this trip.
Ned and I are passengers.”</p>

<p>“Oh if you’re going to act that way about it,
why I’ve got nothin’ more to say,” said Bob, in
rather an aggrieved tone. “I only thought&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You only thought of getting something to
eat,” put in Ned. “Now start her off, Chunky,
and forget you have a stomach.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never be able to do that,” replied Bob
with a sigh, as he threw the lever forward.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> answered promptly and spurted
ahead at a good pace. The boys had reached the
next town below Cresville, running on second
speed, since the current aided them.</p>

<p>“Look out for that rowboat ahead,” cautioned
Jerry to Bob. “They act as if they didn’t
know how to get along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed to a boat containing two girls who
seemed to be trying to row across the stream at a
particularly wide part. They were both at the oars,
but were making little progress.</p>

<p>One girl in the boat looked up and caught sight
of the motor craft. It seemed to give her a fright
for she screamed and began pulling frantically at
the oars. Her companion was likewise affected,
and the two, in their eagerness to reach shore were
rocking the small boat violently by their endeavors.</p>

<p>“They’ll have an upset if they’re not careful,”
said Jerry, who was intently watching the girls.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken that one of the rowers
“caught a crab.” Her oar, dipped into the water
only a little distance, had, when she pulled strongly
on it, given way suddenly. She fell backward and
her companion trying to catch her, leaned to one
side.</p>

<p>This was too much for the frail craft. It careened
far over, water ran over the gunwale, and,
an instant later the two girls were floundering
about in the water.</p>

<p>“To the rescue!” cried Ned, standing up in
the motor boat, and proceeding to take off his
shoes and coat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>PLOTTING</small></h2>


<p>With a turn of the steering wheel Bob sent
the <i>Dartaway</i> toward where the girls were making
frantic efforts to reach their overturned craft.</p>

<p>“Slow down, Chunky!” called Jerry. “You
stand by and Ned and I will get the girls. Watch
out you don’t run us down. There, they’ve both
sunk! We’ll have to dive for ’em!”</p>

<p>Jerry had followed Ned’s example in divesting
himself of his heaviest clothing. The two boys
stood on the gunwale of the motor boat, and, as
the craft slowly circled to where the girls had disappeared,
guided by Bob, Ned and Jerry leaped
overboard.</p>

<p>As they sank beneath the surface Bob swung the
<i>Dartaway</i> in a half curve to avoid the possibility
of striking the rescuers or the girls. He watched
the surface of the water with anxious eyes as he
made a big circle about the place.</p>

<p>Though it seemed several minutes it was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a few seconds before Jerry came up. In one arm
he held the unconscious form of a girl, and he
struck out for the <i>Dartaway</i>. Bob headed for him,
taking care to steer so that he could come broadside
on. A few seconds later Ned appeared, but
he had not found the second girl.</p>

<p>“I can’t&mdash;find&mdash;her&mdash;” he gasped, blowing
the water from his mouth. “I’m going&mdash;down&mdash;again.”</p>

<p>Jerry swam to the motor boat, and, still keeping
the engine going, but throwing out the clutch,
Bob helped lift the unconscious girl over the side.</p>

<p>As she was placed on the cushions she opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” said Jerry. “I’m going back
to help Ned find the other one. Stand by, Bob.”</p>

<p>Plunging over the side once more Jerry struck
out for the swirling eddies that indicated where
Ned had gone down again in his search.</p>

<p>Ducking his head under the water, and opening
his eyes, Jerry peered down on the bottom of the
river to see if he could discern where the body was.
He saw it in a tangle of weeds.</p>

<p>At the same instant Ned caught sight of it, and
made another dive, having come to the surface to
breathe. Ned was the first to reach the girl. He
brought her to the surface, though it was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
work, as she was much heavier than her companion.</p>

<p>Between them Ned and Jerry swam with the
girl to the motor boat, and lifted her over the side.
Then they climbed in themselves.</p>

<p>“Now speed her up, Bob!” cried Jerry as he
donned some of his clothes. “We’ll have to get
to a doctor mighty quick with this last one. She’s
pretty far gone.”</p>

<p>“Shall we head straight for shore?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; down to that dock,” replied Jerry, indicating
one quite a distance down the river, from
which it was evident the girls had come in their
boat. There was quite a crowd on the wharf, and
several small craft were putting out toward the
scene of the accident.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the <i>Dartaway</i> was lying alongside
the dock, and willing hands helped the boys
to lift the unconscious girl out, while the one Jerry
had rescued assisted herself.</p>

<p>There was a scene of confusion. Scores of
people demanded to know what had happened,
when, where and all the particulars.</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Jerry. “You can
hear all about it later. The main thing is to get
this girl to a doctor and see if we can’t save her
life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed the proprietor of the
boat pavilion. “Get out the way there, you folks
that are so anxious to know what’s going on.
Here’s a doctor now.”</p>

<p>A tall man, carrying a small valise, shouldered
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Let me pass, I am a physician,” he said.</p>

<p>Taking off his coat he began working over the
unconscious girl. He was assisted by several
women, and in a few minutes the boys, who had
been looking on, saw the maiden open her eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s all right,” said Jerry. “Come
on, let’s get out of this. I don’t want to answer
a lot of questions. We’ve got a good chance to
skip while the crowd is all in a bunch.”</p>

<p>The boys, after talking the matter over as the
boat sped away decided they would say nothing to
their folks about the rescue.</p>

<p>“If we do they’ll get all excited and think an
accident happens every time we take the boat out,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Suppose they ask us what makes us so wet?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll not lie about it, of course,” said
Jerry. “Only I hate to have a fuss made.”</p>

<p>There was no need to answer questions about
their wet clothes. It was dusk when the boys got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
back to Cresville, and they were able to get into
their homes unobserved.</p>

<p>But if they hoped to have the incident go unnoticed
they were doomed to disappointment.
Two days later, when they were preparing for a
spin one afternoon, Andy Rush came leaping down
to the dock, waving a paper aloft.</p>

<p>“So that’s how you do it!” he exclaimed.
“Brave rescuers&mdash;save lives&mdash;right on the job&mdash;dive
under water&mdash;rush ashore&mdash;rush away
again&mdash;say nothing&mdash;modest&mdash;but it’s all
found out!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now, Andy?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all&mdash;everything&mdash;lots of things&mdash;look
there!” and Andy held out a copy of
the copy of the Cresville weekly.</p>

<p>There, on the first page, under big headlines
the boys saw an account of their rescue of the two
girls. The reporter had spared no language. It
was a chance that seldom came to the little paper
and it was made the most of.</p>

<p>“Well if that isn’t the limit,” said Ned. “I
wonder they didn’t want personal interviews with
us, and all our pictures, besides a story of our experiences
under water.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re heroes all right&mdash;all right!” exclaimed
Andy. “Everybody in Cresville is talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
about it. The paper is selling like hot cakes&mdash;million
copies&mdash;all talking about you&mdash;Gee
Whiz! I wish I was you fellers! You can get
a job in a dime museum now!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” said Jerry in a good-natured
voice. “Here, jump in Andy and we’ll give you
a ride. That will make you forget all about the
rescues and the hero business. Mind, if you ever
refer to it again, you’ll never go on another trip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep quiet, but it’s bound to be talked
about,” said Andy.</p>

<p>They kept on up the river for several miles to
a little summer resort, where there was an ice cream
stand. Bob proposed they go ashore and have
something to eat.</p>

<p>The boys found seats in a quiet corner and were
soon enjoying their refreshments. After the first
plate of cream had vanished Bob proposed
more.</p>

<p>For some minutes past the boys had been hearing
the low sound of voices in the room back of
them, where it seemed, were more chairs and tables.</p>

<p>At first the boys paid no attention to the conversation.
But finally it grew louder and they
could hear two voices in dispute.</p>

<p>“If that isn’t Noddy Nixon I’ll eat my hat,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
said Ned in a whisper. “I’d know his voice anywhere.
But who’s the other?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what it’s all about?” suggested Bob.
“It isn’t spying on them. They are talking so
loud they can’t help being heard all over.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned Jerry.</p>

<p>A second later there came to the ears of the
boys these words:</p>

<p>“I’ve given you all the cash I can afford to.
You must think I’m a millionaire, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Pretty near it, I guess,” was the answer in a
low rumble. “All I know is, I’ve got to have
money.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m broke,” persisted the one whom
the boys had decided was Noddy. “I might allow
you a little something if you helped me out.”</p>

<p>“What is it now? Some more of your tricks
on those motor boys?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Noddy. “Not so loud.
Do you want to have the police after us? Now
I’ll tell you what I want you to do.” His voice
sunk to a whisper, but the walls were so thin that
the boys could distinguish a word here and there.</p>

<p>“Motor boat&mdash;do ’em brown&mdash;fix ’em for
me&mdash;I’ll pay you well,” were some expressions
overheard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if he’s referring to us,” said Jerry.
“I’d like to hear a little more of this.”</p>

<p>The next words came more distinctly though
the sentence was broken here and there by intervening
silences.</p>

<p>“Make it hot&mdash;pay you&mdash;have a good time
soon,” was what came to their ears.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good thing to know this in advance,
that is if it’s us they’re referring to,” said
Ned. “We can be on the watch.”</p>

<p>Having finished their cream, even Bob voting he
had enough, the boys started to leave. As they
walked past the room whence the voices had come,
the door opened and two figures emerged. They
were Bill Berry and Noddy Nixon.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A TEST OF SPEED</small></h2>


<p>At the sight of the motor boys, Noddy started
and seemed to turn back. Bill Berry, however,
was troubled by no such timidity. He pushed forward
while his companion hung back.</p>

<p>“What do you fellows want here?” asked Bill
in no gentle tones. “Are you spying on us? If
you are you’d better look out, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“We’re not ‘spying’ on you as you call it,”
said Jerry. “As for being here, I guess we have
as much right to come here after a plate of cream
as you have. And we didn’t see anything blue
either,” he added.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Bill
Berry in excited tones.</p>

<p>“Just what I said,” replied Jerry in a calm
voice. “The last time you saw us you wanted to
know whether we had seen anything blue. I
thought I’d tell you now that we did not see anything
of such a shade, to save you asking a question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
But we may see it any day. When we do
we’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>The effect of this talk seemed greatly to excite
Bill. He turned first pale, then red. He tried to
speak but the words failed him.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he finally exclaimed. “I’d like
to know what you mean. If the Blue&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Keep still!” exclaimed Noddy. “Come on
Bill. Don’t have anything to do with the sneaks.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” burst out Ned. “You keep
your names to yourself, Noddy Nixon, and speak
civilly of us or you’ll find yourself in deeper water
than the day that you fell into the river!”</p>

<p>Noddy’s face became red at the recollection of
his humiliation at the hands of the motor boys.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you for that yet!” he exclaimed.
“I’m not likely to forget it. You’d better look
out. Me and Bill&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, you lunk-head!” exclaimed Bill in
a hoarse whisper. “Who’s talking too much
now? Do you want them to&mdash;” and then, fearing
that he might say too much Bill fairly dragged
Noddy out of the door with him.</p>

<p>For a few moments the boys stood in silence.
They could hear Noddy and Bill walking down
the path that led to the river, their feet crunching
the gravel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder how they came here,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s watch ’em and see how they leave,” said
Jerry. “We’ll get a line on ’em then.”</p>

<p>Going to the door of the pavilion they saw
Noddy and Bill get in a motor boat that was tied
at the edge of the float. It was a little craft,
hardly more than a rowboat with a small “kicker”
gas engine in it. Noddy got in the bow to steer,
and Bill cranked up. After a number of loud
wheezes and chugs the boat started down the river.</p>

<p>“Little one cylindered affair,” said Bob in contemptuous
tones.</p>

<p>“Never mind, they may make trouble enough
for us with it, even if it has only one cylinder,” put
in Jerry. “It don’t move very fast, to be sure,”
as he watched the craft glide slowly down the
stream, “but you can bet Noddy has some object
in having such a poor boat when he could afford a
better one. He’s up to some game, I haven’t the
least doubt. I wish I could get on to it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he has any plan for making
trouble for us?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Judging from what we overheard a little while
ago, I would say he has,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I think Jerry’s right,” agreed Ned.
“It seems that Bill has something to hide. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wonder what he’s always talking about something
blue for?”</p>

<p>“Did you notice he always gets as far as the
word ‘blue’?” asked Jerry. “Then he stops
as if he was going to mention something more, but
catches himself just in time.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s blue diamonds, blue moon, or
blue feelings,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a blue bird,” put in Ned with a
laugh. Though he spoke off-hand the time was
coming when his words were destined to be remembered
with peculiar significance.</p>

<p>As the <i>Dartaway</i> was chugging along towards
home on second speed the boys heard, from behind,
the exhaust of another boat, that, to judge by the
explosions, was coming along at a rapid clip.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Jerry who was steering.
“I didn’t know there were any other motor boats
around here but ours and Noddy’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s a dandy, all right,” spoke Ned, as he
looked the approaching craft over from bow to
stern. “She is going some. I wonder if we
could beat her. Try, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Jerry was not unwilling to have a little test of
speed with the stranger craft. It came on steadily,
the explosions making almost a continuous roar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
In the boat which was soon opposite the <i>Dartaway</i>,
were two men. The boat was new, and, in the
gathering dusk the boys could read the name on
the bow, <i>Terror</i>.</p>

<p>“Rather piratical,” said Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>The men in the <i>Terror</i> glanced curiously at the
<i>Dartaway</i> as the two craft came opposite. One
of them spoke to the other in a low voice. Then
the one at the wheel adjusted the engine and the
<i>Terror</i> leaped ahead. The two boats were now
on even terms.</p>

<p>The two men could be seen smiling slightly as
they glanced across at the craft the boys were in.
Jerry settled himself at the wheel, and telling Ned
to see to the engine, and keep it well oiled, he prepared
for the race, which had been tacitly agreed
to.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two boats were running
so nearly alike that, looking from one to the other,
both seemed to be standing still. Then slowly,
very slowly, the <i>Terror</i> began to creep away.
Jerry opened the throttle a trifle, and the <i>Dartaway</i>
edged up on her rival.</p>

<p>“They needn’t think they can leave us behind in
that way,” spoke Ned. “We haven’t begun to
go yet.”</p>

<p>Nor, did it appear, had the <i>Terror</i>, either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
From time to time the steersman glanced at the
<i>Dartaway</i>, and, as he saw her keeping even with
him he speeded up his motor a trifle. But Jerry
was not to be outdone, and he did not let the other
boat gain an advantage.</p>

<p>“Do you think we can beat him?” asked Andy
in a low tone, too impressed by the race to talk at
his usual rate.</p>

<p>“It’s a question of engines now,” said Jerry.
“Ours is at the limit.”</p>

<p>So, it appeared, was the <i>Terror’s</i>. For some
time the two men had been content with merely
keeping a straight course, and oiling their motor.</p>

<p>But now, aided either by having gotten into a
place where the current was a little swifter, or her
motor making a few more explosions a minute, the
<i>Dartaway</i> began to forge ahead. At first it was
only by the closest observation that it could be
seen. But, in a little while, the nose of the boys’
boat was three inches past the <i>Terror’s</i>. Then this
increased to ten, to twenty, until, about a mile
above Cresville, the <i>Dartaway</i> was a length ahead
of her rival.</p>

<p>“We’re beating ’em!” cried Ned in his exultation.</p>

<p>“I think so. We certainly are shooting along,”
agreed Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>An instant later the motor of the <i>Dartaway</i>,
with a wheezing cough, began to slow up. Then
with a final explosion, as if in protest, it stopped
altogether. The craft at once lost headway, and
the <i>Terror</i> sprang forward and passed her, winning
the impromptu speed contest.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t the limit!” exclaimed Jerry.
“I wonder what’s the trouble now.”</p>

<p>Ned was frantically trying to get the motor to
start again.</p>

<p>“Seems as if there was no gasolene,” he said.</p>

<p>Jerry quickly opened the forward tank, and
thrust a measuring stick down.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s the trouble!” he exclaimed.
“Not a drop in the tank. We forgot all about
filling it.”</p>

<p>The <i>Terror</i>, after continuing on for about an
eighth of a mile had turned and was coming swiftly
toward the <i>Dartaway</i>. When she was alongside,
the steersman quickly reversed his motor and the
craft, trembling like a frightened thoroughbred,
came to a stop.</p>

<p>“In trouble?” asked the man at the wheel
pleasantly. “You have a mighty fine boat there.
I hope she hasn’t broken down. You had us
beaten.”</p>

<p>“The gasolene has given out,” said Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall we give you a tow to Cresville?” the
steersman went on. “That’s as far as we’re going.”</p>

<p>“We’d be much obliged if you would,” spoke
Jerry. “Does your boat belong there?”</p>

<p>“I think it will after to-night, boys,” said the
man at the motor. “How are you? Came near
beating us,” and he took off the cap that had
shaded his face.</p>

<p>“Why it’s Chief Dalton!” exclaimed Ned, as
he and the others recognized the head of the Cresville
police force. “What in the world are you
doing here, chief?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>SAVED FROM THE FALLS</small></h2>


<p>“Why, I was racing you boys,” replied the officer.</p>

<p>“I see you were. But I never knew you went
in for motor boats,” said Ned. “Is that your
craft?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, though I have an interest in her,”
the chief went on. “You see the Police Commissioners
a few meetings ago decided to purchase
a motor boat. We have quite a river frontage in
Cresville, and lately there have been a number of
robberies of boats and places along the stream.
So it was voted to get a swift craft in which some
of our officers could patrol the river. This is the
boat, and Commissioner Jones, here, and I, were
out giving her a trial spin. We only got her yesterday.”</p>

<p>“She certainly is well named,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, we hope she’ll prove a ‘terror’ by nature
as well as by name,” the chief went on.
“She certainly is speedy enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Commissioner Jones had thrown a
rope to the motor boys. It was made fast to a
cleat on the <i>Dartaway</i>, and then, the <i>Terror</i> being
speeded up, the disabled craft was quickly towed
down the river. Casting off the line at the <i>Dartaway’s</i>
dock the <i>Terror</i> shot on down the river,
the chief and commissioner calling back farewells.</p>

<p>“I want you to do us a favor, Andy,” said Jerry
as the lads were about to separate.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;what is it? Anything&mdash;half my
kingdom&mdash;always willing to oblige&mdash;name it!”
exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, you’re too willing,” said
Jerry with a smile. “What I want is something
very simple&mdash;that is it would be from any one
else. I don’t know how it will hit you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Just don’t say anything about what you heard
this afternoon,” said Jerry. “That is, I mean,
about Noddy and Bill Berry. I believe they are
up to some game. If we lay low we may discover
what it is. If he finds we are talking about everything
connected with him, we may not get at anything.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise,” said Andy eagerly. He was
only too ready to do whatever the other boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wanted him to, as he had hopes of more rides in
the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain,” went on Jerry. “None
of us will say nothing about the occurrence.”</p>

<p>The next few days the boys studied hard in
readiness for examinations.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it rather strange that the
Cresville authorities should buy a motor boat?”
asked Jerry of Ned, one evening as they were returning
from a short run down the river.</p>

<p>“Queer; how do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve always got along without a craft
like that before. There’s never been any river
stealing to speak of. I wonder what’s in the
wind.”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, there is something
out of the ordinary in it,” agreed Ned. “I never
thought of it before. What do you think it
means? Has Noddy anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he has; yet,” replied Jerry.
“I’ll tell you something I heard the other day.
There are some extra detectives in town.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Andy Rush says so,” went on Jerry. “You
know he’s always hanging around police headquarters.
He wants to be a newspaper reporter
some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would think he’d make a good one,” said
Ned. “He’s always finding out things.”</p>

<p>“Well, when he was down to headquarters the
other afternoon,” went on Jerry, “he says he overheard
the chief tell the sergeant in charge to tell
the special detectives about some happening. This
made Andy suspicious, as he had read about the
big private detective agency which supplies officers.
He says he saw a couple of strange men go into
the chief’s office a short time afterward, and stay
for some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Andy’s always imagining things,” said
Ned, sending the motor boat closer in toward the
shore.</p>

<p>“But I think he’s right this time,” spoke Jerry.
“He showed me the men he had reference to, and
I think they are detectives of some kind.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it’s all about?” asked
Bob, getting his mind off something to eat for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve woke up, have you, Chunky?”
asked Jerry. “Well,” he went on, “there’s some
connection between the police boat, the strange
detectives and robberies along the river, that’s
certain. What it is I haven’t found out. But
I’m going to. It may be that Noddy and Bill
are mixed up in it, and if they are, it may concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
us. Noddy seems to have a habit of getting
us into trouble along with himself and his
cronies.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t heard of any robberies,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Jerry. “They’re keeping
them quiet, that’s why. But I happen to know
that the grist mill, down near Tiverton falls was
entered the other night, and quite a sum of money
stolen.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” Ned exclaimed. “Why
didn’t you tell us before?”</p>

<p>“Because I only heard it from Andy Rush a
little while ago,” Jerry replied. “It seems he
was in police headquarters and overheard the chief
talking to one of the men about it. So you see
there’s something going on in this old town after
all.”</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon following this trip the
boys made an early start on a journey down the
river. They were in need of some lubricating oil,
and though they could have bought it in Cresville
they decided to combine business with pleasure
and make a little longer jaunt than usual.</p>

<p>They went to a town called Newton, about
twenty miles below Cresville. On the way they
passed the mill at Tiverton falls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s the place that was robbed,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem as if it put them out of business,”
remarked Ned as the sound of the machinery came
to the ears of the boys.</p>

<p>“They’ve been making some improvements,”
observed Jerry, who was at the wheel. “They’ve
built a new dam and flume. Rather dangerous
too. If a boat got caught in that current it would
be all up with it.”</p>

<p>He pointed to where the mill owners had constructed
a new wall to hold back the water. It
was higher than the old one, and the manner in
which the stream poured over the edge showed
there was much power back of it.</p>

<p>The river was somewhat divided at this point.
While the main stream continued in the regular
course there was an arm that shot off above a
small island, and it was this which was dammed.
Just above the dam the flume took what water was
needed to run the mill. Falling over the dam the
water dashed down on some sharp rocks.</p>

<p>Arriving at Newton the boys spent a little time
viewing the town. Then, having purchased the
oil they started back up the river.</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” suddenly asked Bob,
who was at the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sounds like another boat coming up the
river,” said Jerry. “Maybe it’s the <i>Terror</i>.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s the noise of the falls you hear,” put
in Ned. “We are almost at the grist mill.”</p>

<p>“Oh sure enough, so we are,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Swinging around a bend in the river the boys
came in sight of the dam, over which the water
was pouring in a large volume as the mill had
shut down and none was being diverted into the
big flume. At the same time the occupants of the
<i>Dartaway</i> caught sight of something that caused
them to exclaim in terror.</p>

<p>In the grasp of the powerful current was a small
rowboat, in which were two girls. They were
struggling frantically at the oars, but, in spite of
their efforts to stem the stream, and get beyond
the pull of the waterfall they were slowly drifting
nearer and nearer the edge.</p>

<p>“Put her over there! We’ve got to save
’em!” cried Ned to Bob. “Put her over!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” came from Jerry. “If you
steer over there we’ll be caught in the current too!
Let me take the wheel, Bob. Ned you look after
the engine! Bob you go to the stern and stand
ready to toss ’em a line. I only hope they’ll know
enough to keep hold of it or tie it to their boat.”</p>

<p>Having issued his orders, Jerry hurried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wheel, while the others took the positions designated.
Jerry at once threw the engine to full
speed ahead, and the <i>Dartaway</i> shot forward.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to leave ’em, are you?”
called Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess not!” said Jerry. “I’ve got to back
down to ’em, and stand ready to start ahead suddenly!”</p>

<p>“Save us!” the girls in the boat cried.</p>

<p>One of them had lost an oar, and the other was
too frightened to do anything, even had she the
strength to stem the flow of water. Nearer and
nearer to the dam drifted the boat.</p>

<p>“Sit still! We’ll save you!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>By this time the motor boat was some distance
above the small craft. Jerry sent it toward the
left shore in a long curve. This placed the <i>Dartaway</i>
just above the rowboat. Then he reversed
the engine, and the motor boat began to back down
the stream.</p>

<p>“Stand ready to heave the line!” called Jerry
to Bob. “Now girls!” he went on, “you catch
the rope when he throws it! Wind it around an
oar lock, and hold on to it!”</p>

<p>Bob sent the coils spinning through the air.
They straightened out and several twists fell over
the bow of the small drifting boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Catch hold!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>The girl forward obeyed. Quickly she wound
the coils about one of the oar locks, and held the
loose end tightly.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” sung out Jerry.</p>

<p>With a quick motion he set the clutch for the
first speed forward. The water at the stern of
the <i>Dartaway</i> was churned into foam.</p>

<p>“We’re drifting back!” cried Bob from the
stern. “We’ll go over the dam!”</p>

<p>“Here’s for full speed ahead!” cried Jerry as
he threw the lever over to the last notch, and
swung the gasolene and spark handles well forward.</p>

<p>The foam at the stern became thicker and
whiter. The <i>Dartaway</i> trembled from bow to
rudder. The rope creaked with the strain.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We’re gaining!” cried Ned.
“We’re moving!”</p>

<p>The powerful motor boat had triumphed over
the current and was pulling the occupants in the
small craft out of danger.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>BILL BERRY’S THREATS</small></h2>


<p>Slowly but surely the rowboat was pulled
away from the dangerous brink of the falls. The
two girls, who were pale with fear, regained their
courage, and ventured to get up from the bottom
of the craft, where they were crouched, to peer
over the side.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the <i>Dartaway</i> was steaming
ahead at full speed, pulling the tiny craft after it.
Seeing there was no more danger Jerry slackened
the engine and steered over toward shore.</p>

<p>Just then a white-faced woman ran from a cottage
toward the river.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Are my little girls
drowned?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied Jerry with a smile, as he
pointed to the two children in the boat.</p>

<p>“But we near was, mommer!” cried the smaller
of the two. “Gertrude and I went out in the
boat, and lost an oar, and we drifted toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
falls. The boys come along and pulled us back
or we’d got all wet.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d have gotten a little more than
wet,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh how terrible!” exclaimed the woman.
“If you ever go out in a boat alone again I’ll
make your father move away from this horrible
river.”</p>

<p>Jerry with the aid of Ned and Bob was casting
off the rowboat from the <i>Dartaway</i>, and tying
it to the small dock which extended into the
river.</p>

<p>“Will you boys come in a little while and
rest?” asked the girls’ mother. “I’m sure I
can’t begin to thank you for what you did. You
saved the children’s lives.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we didn’t do any more than any one
would have done under the circumstances,” said
Jerry, who, like most boys hated to have a fuss
made over him or what he did. “I’m afraid we
haven’t time.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting late, I guess we’d better be going,”
added Ned, who likewise was not fond of praise,
and so, bidding the girls and their mother good-bye
the boys started away.</p>

<p>The search light, which was set going as soon
as it was dark, gave a brilliant path of illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
up the center of the stream, though on either side
was gloom. Suddenly the gas lamp, which burned
in the bow, went out.</p>

<p>“There, I meant to fill the carbide tank to-day,”
said Ned, “but I forgot all about it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we can go along just as well in
the dark,” said Jerry. “We have the side lights
going and we’re not liable to meet any other boats.
Better go a little slower, though.”</p>

<p>Ned, accordingly slowed down, and, with
scarcely a sound, so well was the engine muffled
and so smoothly did it work, the <i>Dartaway</i> glided
along. Ned steered over toward the left bank,
to be out of the way of any boats that might be
on the river.</p>

<p>It was getting quite damp, and a fog was obscuring
the view.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing there are not many motor
boats on the river, or we might run into one, or
be run into,” said Ned. “I wonder if the police
boat is in commission yet.”</p>

<p>“I heard she’d be here next week for good,”
spoke Bob.</p>

<p>As every one knows who has been on the water,
or for that matter, out in a fog, sounds carry much
farther and with much more distinctness under
such conditions than ordinarily. It was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of this that the boys heard, borne down the river
to them, the sound of voices.</p>

<p>“Now I won’t take any of your threats, Bill
Berry!” they heard some one say.</p>

<p>With a quick but noiseless motion Ned slowed
the motor down to first speed. The craft made
scarcely a sound and glided through the water
like a ghost, with one red and one green eye.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet!” commanded Jerry. “It
sounded like Noddy’s voice. If it was we must
find out what he’s up to.”</p>

<p>They listened intently, and heard a confused
murmur. The words borne to them must have
been exceptionally loud or else an echo carried
them. Then, again, they heard plainly.</p>

<p>“You needn’t try to scare me, Bill,” spoke the
voice, which all three now recognized as Noddy’s.
“You’re as deep in this thing as I am, and if
you try to give me away I can do the same for
you.”</p>

<p>Then came the low tones of some one evidently
pleading with Noddy.</p>

<p>“Steer close up, under those overhanging
trees,” said Jerry to Ned. At the same time he
threw the edge of a tarpaulin over the red and
green side lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Silently the <i>Dartaway</i> glided into a regular
bower under the trees. It was dark, and made
an excellent hiding place. Ned threw out the
gear, but the engine was allowed to run slowly.</p>

<p>In their hiding place the motor boys could
hear the voices more plainly now. They knew
Noddy and Bill were plotting together over
something. From the direction of the sound of
the voices Noddy and Bill appeared to be upon
a small hill overlooking the river.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to have that money,” Bill could be
heard to say. “I need it, and if you don’t get it
for me I’ll&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“It won’t do a bit of good to threaten,” interrupted
Noddy. “I’m not afraid of you. You
were just as bad as I was in the mine and the
kidnapping business. You don’t want to go to jail
any more than I do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” sneered Bill, “but I’ve got to
have money to live. I could do that in jail without
any money, but I can’t outside, which is a curious
thing. But I need some cash and you’ve got to
get it for me.”</p>

<p>“Where can I get any money?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“I don’t care where you get it,” said Bill in no
gentle tones. “You can beg it or borrow it&mdash;or
steal it for all I care. You get some, that’s all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
or I’ll go to the police and tell them all I know.”</p>

<p>“You’re trying to blackmail me!” exclaimed
Noddy, who, from his voice seemed almost ready
to burst into tears. “You’re threatening me.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only way to make you do anything,”
growled Bill. “Now I tell you what; if I don’t
have some cash inside of two weeks there’s going
to be trouble for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of you!” cried Noddy, stung
to sudden anger by the helplessness of his position.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you!” exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>It sounded as though there was a scuffle between
the two in the bushes. Now and then muffled
cries could be heard.</p>

<p>“We’d better go and help Noddy!” exclaimed
Ned. “He’s no friend of ours, but I don’t want
to see that Bill Berry get the best of him.”</p>

<p>The three boys were so excited they forgot to
maintain the caution they had observed at first.
In moving about in the boat, as the struggle continued,
the tarpaulins were knocked from the lamps
and the red and green rays glowed out.</p>

<p>All at once the sounds of the struggle ceased.
It became very quiet. But, through the darkness
came the hoarse whisper from Noddy:</p>

<p>“There’s the police boat! They’re after us!
Come on Bill.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>AN ALARM OF FIRE</small></h2>


<p>An instant later the motor boys could hear a
crashing of bushes and underbrush that told them
Noddy and Bill were in flight.</p>

<p>“Shall we take after them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” inquired Jerry. “We
don’t want to leave our boat. Besides, if we did
catch them, which is doubtful, owing to the darkness,
what would we say?”</p>

<p>“We might ask them what they were talking
about,” said Bob.</p>

<p>The retreating footsteps of Bill and Noddy
were becoming fainter and fainter. Now they
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we may as well start for home,”
said Jerry. “We can’t gain anything by staying
here.”</p>

<p>It was rather late when the motor boys got
home after locking up the <i>Dartaway</i>. They did
not go out again until Friday afternoon when they
started for a park resort up stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was running to perfection, having
been overhauled by the boys, the engine well
oiled and some adjustments made. The motor
was “finding itself” and was working more
smoothly with every revolution. Obedient to helm
and throttle the craft went spinning up the stream
like some big river horse.</p>

<p>As the boys in the boat swung around a sharp
bend, the turn being hidden by thick trees, they
almost ran into a small schooner that was beating
up against the wind.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned to Bob, who was steering.</p>

<p>Bob swung the wheel well around and started
to reverse the engine, when Jerry sprang forward
from the stern, where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Keep on, full speed ahead!” he called. “It’s
the only way to avoid hitting him!”</p>

<p>At the same time he moved the gasolene and
sparking levers forward, and, as the <i>Dartaway</i>
leaped ahead under the quickening impulse, Jerry
steered to the left of the schooner.</p>

<p>His quick action saved a collision. As it was,
the motor boat barely grazed the side of the other
craft, and then shot out into the middle of the
stream.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fresh kids?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
called a voice from the schooner, and the boys
looked over to see a ragged man shaking his fist
at them.</p>

<p>“I’ll have the law on you!” the skipper went
on. “You’ve got no right to make a turn like
that at full speed without blowing a whistle.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s got us right,” spoke Jerry in low
tones. “It’s our fault. Sailing vessels have the
right of way.”</p>

<p>The man appeared to be all alone on the craft
for he remained at the wheel, and no one else
came on deck.</p>

<p>“You’d ought to have kept a little more in
shore,” said Jerry. “Unloaded vessels are supposed
to at this point as it’s deeper farther out,
and the loaded ones take that channel.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hang about the channel!”
cried the man. “You nearly run me down, and
you didn’t blow any warning. If I catch you at
it again I’ll sink your tin-pan of a boat if I get
a chance.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get the chance!” fired back Ned,
turning to look at the schooner which was disappearing
around the bend. As he did so the boy
gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Look at the stern of that boat!” cried Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob and Jerry looked. Under the overhanging
ornamental work was the name:</p>

<p class="noic">BLUEBIRD</p>

<p>“Nothing remarkable about that,” said Bob.
“It could just as well have been redbird, or yellowbird
or blackbird.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” put in Jerry excitedly.
“It may have been the ‘blue’ thing that Bill
Berry referred to when he quarreled with us.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is,” said Ned. “There’s something
queer going on along this river, and we’ll
find it out sooner or later.”</p>

<p>They ran along for several miles, and were
approaching a small village called Westville,
when, as they came around a bend that hid from
sight a straight stretch of water which led past
the town, they heard shouts of excitement.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we’ve run into now,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks like a fire,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“It is a fire!” exclaimed Ned. “See, that
barn upon the hill is all ablaze!”</p>

<p>Looking to where he pointed Bob and Jerry
saw the stable structure, near a handsome country
residence was spouting flames. About it a crowd
was gathered, and the boys could see men leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
out horses and running out wagons, carriages and
farm machinery.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the fire department is,” said
Jerry. “I heard they had a cracker-jack one
here.”</p>

<p>“There they come!” cried Ned pointing to
where a crowd of men and boys could be seen
hurrying down a hill over which led the road into
the village. In the midst of the throng was some
sort of machine which was being pulled by long
ropes.</p>

<p>“It’s an old hand engine!” cried Bob. “I
thought they had a steamer here.”</p>

<p>“Come on; let’s go up and see it work!” cried
Jerry.</p>

<p>The motor boat was run close to the bank, and,
having been tied to an overhanging tree the boys
raced up the slope toward the burning barn.</p>

<p>By this time the hand engine had arrived. It
was one of the old-fashioned kind. Two long
handles worked a pump mounted on a tank. Into
this tank water had to be poured by pails, and
from the bottom ran two lines of hose connected
to the pumps. The hose was carried on a separate
reel. In a few minutes the volunteer firemen, having
gotten in each other’s way as many times as
was possible, had the hose attached. One little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
man with a bald head and a fuzz of white whiskers
on his chin was giving all sorts of orders.</p>

<p>Then two lines of men and boys were formed,
each person with a bucket in hand, the files leading
to a small brook which ran near the barn. From
one to another the buckets were passed, going
down empty on one side and going along filled
on the other. As fast as possible the pails were
emptied into the tank.</p>

<p>The men at the handles or “brakes” as they
were called were pumping away for dear life, and
soon a feeble stream came from one hose nozzle.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried the crowd, and half a score
of willing hands grabbed the line and started
toward the burning barn with it. A little later,
the pump having gotten in its stride, so to speak,
sent a stream from the other hose.</p>

<p>Again there was a shout of approval, and the
two streams were soon playing on the flames. But
the fire had gained too much headway to succumb
to anything short of the efforts of a regular department.
The blaze mounted higher and higher.</p>

<p>“The house is on fire! The house is on fire!”
a score of voices yelled.</p>

<p>Sure enough, some sparks from the barn had
fallen on the shingled roof of the residence and
there were several tiny spurts of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the barn go, boys!” called the chief.
“Let’s save the house.”</p>

<p>Willing hands dragged the clumsy machine
nearer the residence while the men at the nozzles
ran back, and prepared to squirt water on the
roof. Once more the buckets passed along the
line.</p>

<p>Clank! Clank! went the handles.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried the chief.
“There’s no water coming from the hose!”</p>

<p>The nozzle-men had climbed up on two ladders
which were hastily reared against the side of the
house. They turned the hose toward the spurts
of flame, but no water came. The trouble was
the pump was not powerful enough to force the
fluid to so great a height.</p>

<p>“Pump! Pump!” cried the chief.</p>

<p>The men at the handles redoubled their efforts.
For a minute or so a feeble stream trickled from
the nozzles. Then, with a cough and a wheeze
the pump gave out. It had broken under the
unusual pressure, not being in the best of repair
at any time.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” cried the chief.
“The house will go!”</p>

<p>“Form a chain gang!” cried the owner of the
residence. “Have the men stand in line from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the brook to the ladder and pass the buckets along
and up to the roof!”</p>

<p>“Good idea!” yelled the chief. “Hurry
men!”</p>

<p>It was easy to plan but hard to put into operation.
The buckets were full when they left the
hands of the men nearest the stream, but when
they got to those on the roof there was barely a
quarter pail-full of the fluid left, so much had
spilled out.</p>

<p>The volunteer fire fighters did the best with
what they had, but the flames were gaining on
them. The roof was afire in a dozen places. As
fast as one spot was put out another would ignite.</p>

<p>Jerry ran to the disabled engine. He seemed to
be examining the hose. Then he hurried back
to the chief.</p>

<p>“How many feet of hose have you?” he asked
of that excited official.</p>

<p>“About four hundred. But don’t bother me!
What good is hose when you haven’t a pump?
Look out the way!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what good it is!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Uncouple it from the engine and run
it down to our boat!” and he pointed to where
the <i>Dartaway</i> was tied at the shore.</p>

<small>THE QUEER TRAMP</small></h2>


<p>“What good will that do?” cried the chief.
“Haven’t I got troubles enough without you
bothering me? This whole place is going up in
smoke!”</p>

<p>“No it won’t if you do as I say,” insisted
Jerry. “Have your men run that hose down to
our boat!”</p>

<p>“Have you got a force pump there?” demanded
the chief halting in his intention of shouting
some new order through his trumpet.</p>

<p>“That’s what we have, and a powerful one
too,” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the chief. “Here boys!
Run the line down to the motor boat!”</p>

<p>Wondering whether their chief had taken leave
of his senses the men obeyed. A curious crowd
gathered to see what was going on. Some even
deserted the bucket brigade lines.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave my house to burn up!” cried
the distracted owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think you can attach the hose to
the engine?” asked Bob, as he ran along beside
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not to the engine but to the pump; the auxiliary
pump,” said Jerry. “I guess you forgot we
have a regular force pump which is worked by the
engine. Not the one that pumps up water to cool
the cylinders, but the one in the stern that is
intended for a hose to be attached to. It’s for
use in case the boat gets afire, or to wash it off
when it’s dirty. It’s a fine pump, double acting,
but we never had occasion to use it, and we haven’t
any hose for it. I measured the fire hose, and it
will just fit on the pump nozzle.”</p>

<p>By this time the men dragging the hose were
at the <i>Dartaway</i>. They stared in wonder at the
trim craft, for it was the first time many of them
had ever seen a motor boat.</p>

<p>“Fasten the line on there!” cried Jerry showing
the men where the pump was. “I’ll start the
engine!”</p>

<p>He threw out the gear, and started the motor,
which, running free, soon attained a terrific speed.
Then Jerry threw in the clutch connecting with the
pump. In an instant the machine began to suck
up water from the river.</p>

<p>A few seconds later there came a shout from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the other end of the hose, where some men were
holding it ready to play a stream on the roof,
which was now blazing furiously.</p>

<p>“By Hook! You’ve done the trick!” exclaimed
the chief. “I didn’t think your little
machine would force water so far.”</p>

<p>The chief ran back to direct his men, while
quite a crowd stayed to watch the motor boys in
their unexpected role of firemen.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the firemen had the blaze
under control. It had just begun to eat through
the shingles, but, so well did the volunteers play
the water on, and, thanks to the <i>Dartaway’s</i> pump,
so much was there of the fluid, that the fire soon
got discouraged and, save for a few little tongues
of flame, it was out five minutes later.</p>

<p>The house was saved, but the barn was a total
loss. Seeing that there was no further need of
a stream on the roof, the chief directed the men
to play on the burning embers of the stable, which
had collapsed into a huge bon-fire.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon I can call off my men now,”
said the chief some time later, when there was only
a little smoke to show where the barn had stood.
“I guess the danger’s over. One of you men
take a look upon the house roof to see there are no
sparks left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A volunteer fireman scrambled up and reported
that the roof-fire was out completely.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll pull up and go home,” went on
the chief. “I’m sure we’re much obliged to you
boys. I don’t know what we’d ’a done only for
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” spoke Jerry. “Glad we
happened along in time to be of service.”</p>

<p>The hose was uncoupled from the boat pump,
and coiled on the reel, while the hand engine was
dragged out into the road in preparation for being
taken back to quarters.</p>

<p>The motor boys prepared to continue on their
trip. Just as Jerry was adjusting the engine in
readiness to start off, a man came running down
the bank to the river.</p>

<p>“Hi; you boys!” he called.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it; more fire?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, but Mr. Dudley wants to know if you
won’t come up and stay to supper. He wants to
thank you, and he’s asked the other fire department
also.”</p>

<p>“The other fire department, eh?” remarked
Jerry in a low voice. “They must count us as
one. Shall we go up, boys?”</p>

<p>“If you leave it to me I say yes every time,”
put in Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh we knew that,” said Jerry. “What do
you say, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Oh I could toy with a bit of food if it isn’t
too heavy,” said Ned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Dudley we’re much obliged to him,
and we’ll be right up,” said Jerry, and the man,
who seemed to be a helper about the place, ran
back to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dudley and several of the servants had
set a table in the big dining room. The members
of the volunteer fire department were standing
awkwardly around discussing the events of the last
few hours, and Mr. Dudley was going about from
one to the other thanking them for what they had
done.</p>

<p>“Here comes the real heroes of the day!”
cried the fire chief as the boys entered. “They
are the ones who jumped right into the breach and
pulled us out of the hole.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Mr. Dudley, hurrying over
and shaking hands with the boys. “I don’t know
your names yet,” he went on, “but I’m a thousand
times obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Jerry introduced himself and his comrades, and
soon every one was at his ease, the volunteers
firing question after question at Bob, Ned and
Jerry as to how their “machine” worked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, never mind the fire, but sit down and
eat,” cried Mr. Dudley. “I’m sure you’re hungry
and that you all deserve better than we have
here. You must make allowances for the meal.
It was gotten ready in a hurry, and we’re a little
upset.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be,” said the chief.
“Good land, we ain’t had as much excitement as
this, no sir, not in ten years.”</p>

<p>The meal was a good one in spite of the adverse
circumstances under which it was prepared,
and the boys and every one else ate heartily.</p>

<p>During a lull in the serving of the victuals, the
chief arose at his place.</p>

<p>“Members of the Towanda Fire Department,”
he said, “I have a motion to make. I know this
ain’t a regular meeting, but I ask for a suspension
of the rules.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! You’re all right! Go ahead chief!
Make a dozen motions if you want to!” were
some of the cries that greeted the head of the
volunteers.</p>

<p>“Then I move you that we elect these three
boys, who helped us so well to-day, honorary members
of our department!” exclaimed the chief.</p>

<p>“Second the motion!” cried every member of
the volunteers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess there’s no use to take a vote on that
proposition,” the chief went on. “You’re elected
unanimously!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much,” said Jerry, speaking
for himself and his chums.</p>

<p>There was a cheer for the boys, and congratulations
on every side. Mrs. Dudley came up, shook
hands with the boys, and with tears in her eyes
thanked them for their aid in saving her home.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I would have done if it
had burned down,” she said. “I’ve lived here
so long I don’t believe I ever could live in a new
place. I must write and tell you boys’ mothers
what you did for me.”</p>

<p>As soon as they could, the boys made an excuse
for leaving. Shaking hands with their host and
hostess, they went down to the motor boat, followed
by about half the members of the fire department.
Amid cheers from the men the boys started
off.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better cut out the trip to the
park,” said Jerry. “How about going straight
home?”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” came from Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after the side lamps and the search
lantern had been lighted, the <i>Dartaway</i> was swung
down the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly from the gloom in front of them,
there sounded a loud crash. Then a bumping
noise, followed by confused shouts.</p>

<p>“Trouble of some kind!” exclaimed Jerry.
He swung the search lamp in the direction from
which the noise had come. In the white blinding
glare of the gas lamp the boys saw the outlines of
a schooner, partially hidden behind some big black
object.</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Bluebird</i>!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“And something has run into her!” cried Jerry.
“I wonder what it is. Put us over that way,
Ned.”</p>

<p>Ned shifted the wheel. As the <i>Dartaway</i> came
nearer, and the black object was illuminated more
by the search lamp, the boys could see that it was
a barge loaded with hay which had drifted upon
the schooner.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Save me! The schooner is
sinking!” cried a voice from the darkness.</p>

<p>“You’d better jump!” another voice answered.
“I can’t pull the barge back!”</p>

<p>The boys were now near enough to see what
was happening. The barge was broadside on to
the current. It was so big that the force of the
river was bearing it hard against the side of the
schooner, which was careening badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there anyone on the barge?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes!” came back the answer. “Can you
throw me a line and pull me back? I don’t want
to sink the vessel!”</p>

<p>“Stand by to catch!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>He stood up in the bow and cast a line to a dark
figure that ran out to the end of the barge, nearest
the motor boat. The man skillfully caught the
line, and fastened it to a cleat.</p>

<p>Then, under Jerry’s direction, Ned swung the
<i>Dartaway</i> about in a big circle, taking care not to
foul the tow line. The rope was fastened to the
stern of the motor boat, and, when the latter was
pointed up stream it tautened suddenly.</p>

<p>Ned put the engine at full speed, and slowly,
very slowly, for the weight was considerable, the
hay barge was pulled away from the schooner.
The latter, relieved of the pressure, began to
right.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried the man on the barge.
He was in the full glare of the search lamp, which
Jerry had reversed to play on the barge, and the
boys saw that he was a tramp. His clothes hung
in rags about him, and his face looked as if it had
not felt a razor in months.</p>

<p>“Pull her up the river a way and tie her to
the bank, if you will,” the tramp said, stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
out of the glare of the light suddenly. “She
drifted down stream with me,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Who does it belong to?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Then, all at once, there
came a splash in the water.</p>

<p>“Some one has fallen overboard!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry flashed the light down on the surface of
the river. In the white glare the tramp could be
seen striking out for shore. He was swimming
well, and seemed in no need of assistance so Jerry
did not stop the towing of the barge to put over
to him.</p>

<p>“Well of all the queer tramps he’s the limit,”
said Bob. “He don’t seem to mind getting a
bath. Wonder how he came to fall in.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t fall in, he jumped,” said Jerry.
“There’s something queer behind this.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>CAMPING OUT</small></h2>


<p>“Hurry up, run the barge ashore and let’s
see what he’s up to,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry. “We might as well
see this thing through while we’re at it.”</p>

<p>The barge, with its load of hay was no light
weight to tow, but the boys were satisfied to get
it out of the way of the schooner. They steered
over toward the bank, and, as Ned slowed up the
engine, Jerry and Bob leaped ashore and tied the
line to a tree.</p>

<p>“We can come and get the rope to-morrow,”
said Jerry. “Now to find our queer tramp.”</p>

<p>The hay barge was now securely tied, and, as
the boys could see in the light of the search lantern,
the schooner had righted. There seemed to be no
movement on board, and the boys concluded that
whoever had been afraid of losing his life in the
accident had quieted down.</p>

<p>“Everybody listen,” said Jerry. “I want to
see if we can hear the tramp moving on shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The engine had been stopped and there was no
sound to disturb the stillness of the night. Suddenly,
from the bush that lined the bank of the
river, there came a crackling that betokened some
person was moving through them.</p>

<p>“Maybe this is our tramp,” said Bob.</p>

<p>With a quick movement Ned, who was standing
in the bow of the boat, turned the search light on
shore. As he did so there emerged from the
underbrush a figure that was dripping with water.
One glance showed the boys it was the tramp of
the hay barge.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the tramp. “You’re here,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Just about,” said Jerry. “Here’s your load
of hay,” and he motioned to the barge tied to the
bank.</p>

<p>“Oh that’s not mine,” the tramp said pleasantly.
“You see the way it was I went to sleep on that
barge. It was tied to the bank, some where along
here. The first thing I knew there was a collision
and I heard some one on the schooner shouting
that I was sinking him.”</p>

<p>“I guess you came pretty near it,” put in
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; well maybe I did, but it wasn’t my fault.
The barge must have drifted down stream while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I was asleep. Then you boys came along in the
nick of time, and&mdash;well you know the rest.”</p>

<p>“Are you stopping around here?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, not so’s you could notice it,” the tramp
replied. “I’m a sort of wandering minstrel you
might say, here to-day and gone to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you?” asked Jerry,
taking pity on the man’s rather forlorn appearance.
“Give you a ride down to the town, or
anything like that?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks just the same,” replied the tramp.
“It’s going to be a warm night, and my clothes
will soon dry. Besides I’m a nature lover and a
student of the stars. I like to sleep out of doors,
so I’ll just curl up here under a bush and sleep the
sleep of the just. In the morning I will hie me on
my way again, fair sirs.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t help you?” asked Ned, who,
with the other boys, was somewhat puzzled by the
man’s queer manner and rather high-flown talk.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell you the truth the only thing you
could do for me would be to hand over a chicken
sandwich or two,” the tramp said. “And I don’t
suppose you carry such luxuries with you on your
cruises.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you wouldn’t mind roast beef, corned
beef and cheese sandwiches,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t make fun of him,” spoke Jerry in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” replied Chunky. “I’ve got some
here.”</p>

<p>He fumbled in a side locker of the boat and
drew out a bulky package. Then he put his hand
in again and brought forth a bottle of ginger ale.</p>

<p>“Where in the world did you get that stuff?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I saved it from the dinner at Mr. Dudley’s,”
answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, you are the limit!” exclaimed Jerry,
while Ned joined in the laugh at Chunky.</p>

<p>“Here you go,” said Bob to the tramp, extending
some of the food and a bottle of ginger ale.
“It will last until you can get something more.”</p>

<p>“You are too generous,” spoke the tramp, but
though his tone was bantering as his previous
speech had been, the boys could see he was in
earnest.</p>

<p>He came close to the boat and accepted the
sandwiches and bottle which Bob held out. Then,
making his way up the bank again, he was soon
lost to sight in the shadows, while he called back a
friendly “good-night.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can go home now,” spoke Jerry.
“We’ve had adventures enough for one night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and if I’m not mistaken this one will lead
to others,” Ned put in.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Jerry, with sudden
interest.</p>

<p>“Did you notice the tramp’s face?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly; why?”</p>

<p>“Well, you remember how much he looked as
if he needed a shave when he came in the glare
of the light as he stood on the barge?”</p>

<p>“I sure do.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t look so when he took the
sandwiches from Bob, did he?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” put in Bob. “He was as
clean as if he’d just been to the barber’s.”</p>

<p>“You don’t s’pose he got shaved in the woods,
after his bath, do you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“You mean we must have been mistaken in
thinking he needed one?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, I mean his appearance changed after he
fell or jumped into the water. His ‘whiskers’
came off.”</p>

<p>“Then he was disguised!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what I believe,” Ned replied. “And
what with a disguised tramp on a hay barge, a
mysterious schooner named <i>Bluebird</i>, and Bill
Berry’s curious reference to something ‘blue’
I shouldn’t wonder but what there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
strange going on around these parts. And we’re
liable to get mixed up in it at any time.”</p>

<p>“Not any more to-night, if you please,” spoke
Jerry. “I’m dead tired, and I want to go to bed.
If there are going to be any more adventures I’m
going to duck.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t s’pose we can find out anything
more to-night,” admitted Ned. “So let’s head
for home.” And they did.</p>

<p>The next day the boys made a trip up the river
to where they had tied the hay barge. They found
several men on the craft, discussing how it had
happened the boat had moved from the place
where they had tied it. The boys moored their
craft and went on the barge to get their rope.</p>

<p>“So this is your tow line, eh?” asked a man
who seemed to be in charge of the barge.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” replied Jerry, and he related
what happened the night previous.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I might have knowed suthin’ would
break loose if I let th’ men have a night off,” the
farmer, for such he was, went on. “We was
bringin’ this load of fodder down stream, an’ we
had t’ tie up as it was gittin’ dusk. Some of th’
boys wanted t’ go off t’ town t’ a dance, an’ I let
’em, as we don’t have many amusements on th’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
farm. When we come back we couldn’t find th’
boat, an’ we thought some one had stole her. We
went back t’ town an’ stayed all night an’ come
trampin’ down t’ th’ river this mornin’. Lucky
we found th’ craft, an’ the hay not stole. I’m
sure I’m much obliged t’ you boys.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re welcome,” replied Jerry, not
saying anything about the tramp, who, it appeared,
had had no hand in the boat drifting away.</p>

<p>Securing their line the boys went back to their
boat.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?” asked Ned. “I’d like
to get off in the woods somewhere and camp out.
I wish vacation was here and we could take our
cruise.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a little one now,” suggested Jerry.
“We don’t need to bother with a tent. We can
go off somewhere, and stay over Sunday, and sleep
on board.”</p>

<p>Things were soon in readiness and the start
was made about six o’clock that evening. They
went some miles, and when ten o’clock came the
boys lighted the gasolene stove and made coffee,
for the night was quite chilly. They set the small
table amidships, and, with the food they had
brought along, they made a good meal. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
were so tired, with the good healthy exhaustion
of exercise in the open air, that it was not long
after this before they were all sound asleep.</p>

<p>It must have been past midnight when Jerry,
who was sleeping forward, was awakened by feeling
the boat careen to one side.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he cried, sitting up on
the bunk.</p>

<small>THE MOTOR BOAT MISSING</small></h2>


<p>There was no sound save the ripple of water
past the side of the craft, and the distant gurgle
where the stream flowed over a stony place that
formed miniature rapids.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked Jerry again.</p>

<p>This time he heard a splash in the water as if
a big fish was moving about.</p>

<p>Jerry knew the river did not boast of sufficiently
large finny specimens to careen a boat the size of
the <i>Dartaway</i>. Nevertheless something had shifted
her.</p>

<p>Jerry was wide awake now. He stepped out
into the enclosed space between the bunks that
formed a sort of cabin. As he did so he felt the
boat rock again; this time so violently as to almost
cause him to lose his balance.</p>

<p>To avoid falling Jerry thrust out his hand, and
it hit Bob, who was sleeping on the other side of
the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right! All right! I’m goin’ to get right
up!” exclaimed Bob, turning over but evincing
no other desire to do as he said he would. He
evidently imagined himself in his bed at home,
and with his father calling him to get up, for Bob
was no light slumberer.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, sitting up
suddenly. He was easily awakened, and the sound
of Bob’s voice, with the movement of Jerry served
to arouse him. “What’s the matter?” he repeated.
“Are they after us? Is Noddy up to
his old tricks?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s the matter,” replied
Jerry in a low voice. “I was awakened by feeling
the boat rock, and I got up to see what the trouble
was. I haven’t found out yet.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’re adrift,” suggested Ned. “We
may have swung down stream and hit the bank.”</p>

<p>Jerry reached for a swinging lantern, and, parting
the canvas side awnings, held the light over the
rail. By the gleam the boys could see that they
were still tied to the shore trees by bow and stern
lines.</p>

<p>“The boat hasn’t drifted,” said Jerry. “Something
moved it. I heard a noise in the water as
if there was a big fish, but who ever heard of
whales or sharks in the river, and it must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
been something as big as that to cause us to careen
so.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a log that hit us,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“I think not; I would know the bump of a log,”
said Jerry. “Hark! What’s that?”</p>

<p>Both boys listened intently. Off toward the
farther bank could be heard a faint splashing, as
if a large body was moving in the water.</p>

<p>“Light the search lantern, and we’ll throw a
beam over in that direction,” said Ned. Jerry
crept forward and soon had the big illuminator
kindled. Then he suddenly turned the beams full
on in the direction of the splashing sound.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing could be distinguished
save the green bank that bordered the river.
Then, as Jerry swung the search light in a half
circle he “picked up” a dark figure that was
crawling up the sloping shore.</p>

<p>“It’s a man!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s a man
with ragged clothes on! I’ll bet it’s the same
tramp that was on the hay barge!”</p>

<p>Jerry was gazing intently through the opened
canvas sides of the boat at the figure. Sure
enough it was that of a man, and, he seemed to
have just swam across the river. He climbed the
bank, and, turning to take a look at the motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
boat, placed himself full in the glare of the gas
lamp.</p>

<p>“It’s our queer tramp all right!” exclaimed
Jerry. “I wonder if it was he who moved the
boat.”</p>

<p>“Must have been,” decided Ned, after a moment’s
thought.</p>

<p>The next instant the figure, turning as if to take
a last look at the boat, plunged into the underbrush
and was lost to view.</p>

<p>The morning came without further adventures
and after breakfast they walked for a mile or
more through the woods, and emerged into a big
field. There were no houses in sight and the boys
did not know what settlement they might be near,
for they were about twenty miles from home, in
a part of the country they seldom visited.</p>

<p>“Looks like some sort of habitation over there,”
said Bob, pointing to the left.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything,” replied Jerry. “Where
do you see a house?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any house, but I see smoke,” replied
Bob. “Where there’s smoke there’s fire,
and where there’s fire there’s sure to be some one
living.”</p>

<p>As they came nearer to whence the smoke arose
they could see half hidden in the bushes a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of log cabin. It was almost in ruins, and the
one window was devoid of glass.</p>

<p>In front of the hut there smouldered the remains
of a fire, and, from some old pots and pans
lying about, as well as odds and ends of food scattered
around, it was evident that some one had
been dining in rough and ready fashion.</p>

<p>“Looks like a camping-out party had been
here,” said Jerry. “They weren’t very particular
where they stayed though. That hut seems to
have seen its best days.”</p>

<p>“More like it’s a tramps’ shack,” observed
Ned. “Maybe our friend of the hay barge hangs
out here.”</p>

<p>The boys went closer to the fire. There were
chickens’ feathers and bones on the ground.</p>

<p>“They lived high, at any rate,” said Bob. “I
wouldn’t mind a bit of broiled fowl myself.”</p>

<p>“Whoever was here left their knife behind,”
said Bob, stooping over and picking up an expensive
one. “Doesn’t look like the kind tramps
usually carry.” He turned it over in his hand,
and uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Cut yourself?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Look there!” cried Bob, pointing to the silver
plate on one side of the handle. On it was carved:
“N. Nixon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Noddy’s knife!” came from Ned. “I wonder
what he could have been doing here.”</p>

<p>“It’s like a good many other things connected
with Noddy,” said Jerry. “No telling what he’s
up to until it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Shall we take it along or leave it?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Better take it,” suggested Jerry. “It might
come in handy for evidence some time, and if
we leave it some one might come along and steal
it. Put it in your pocket, Chunky.”</p>

<p>Strolling leisurely they retraced their steps, and
soon were on the rude path they had followed in
coming from the river.</p>

<p>Jerry was in the lead. When he came to the
bank of the stream he suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Snake?” called out Ned.</p>

<p>“We must have come the wrong road,” said
Jerry. “The boat isn’t here.”</p>

<p>The other boys hurried forward and stood beside
him. There was no sign of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” said Bob. “I thought we were
on the right path coming back. It was just like
the one we went over on.”</p>

<p>“It was the same,” insisted Ned. “There’s
where the <i>Dartaway</i> was tied up. I know that
willow tree. See, I left my sweater on it, and it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
there yet,” and he pointed to where the red
garment fluttered in the wind.</p>

<p>“Then where’s the boat?” asked Jerry. “Has
it floated away?”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have,” insisted Ned. “It was
tied too securely.”</p>

<p>“Then she’s been stolen!” exclaimed Jerry,
and he ran down to the edge of the river, the others
following.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it, the <i>Dartaway</i> was
gone. There was not a sign of the craft up stream
or down.</p>

<p>“Some one’s been here all right,” said Jerry.
“See those are not our tracks,” and he pointed to
the soft mud in which were several prints of large
feet which had worn hob-nailed shoes. In the
middle of the sole was a design of an arrow, which
the maker of the shoes had put on them in big
nails, and this device was plainly visible in the
soil.</p>

<p>“Well, this is tough luck!” exclaimed Bob.
“I’d like to find the man with the arrow shoes.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather find the boat,” said Jerry in a dejected
voice. “I wonder what in the world we’re
going to do,” and he sat down on the grassy bank.
The others, looking sadly at where their beloved
boat had been moored, took places beside Jerry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE SEARCH</small></h2>


<p>For a while no one felt like speaking. The
shock was too much for them. They could hardly
realize that their craft was gone. Finally Jerry
spoke.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find her!” he exclaimed.
“She’s somewhere on the river, up or down, and
we’ve got to go after her. She can’t have been
taken very far, for we’ve not been gone more than
three hours.”</p>

<p>“If she was run at full speed she could get a
good way off in that time,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think the best plan will be to start up or
down the river,” said Jerry. “Chances are who
ever took the boat went up, as they wouldn’t
risk cruising past Cresville with it. So we’ll start
up I think.”</p>

<p>“You mean walk?” asked Bob who was not
inclined to any exertion when he could help it.</p>

<p>“Well I don’t see any one coming along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a launch or a water automobile, Chunky,” said
Jerry. “I guess we’ll have to walk, a way at
any rate. We’ll inquire of every one who lives
along the river if they have seen the boat.
We may get a line on her that way. So let’s start.”</p>

<p>“I wish we’d taken some of the grub out of
her before we went away,” said Bob with a sigh.</p>

<p>“If they’ll give us back the boat they can have
all the victuals and welcome,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re not as hungry as I am,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use worrying over that part
of it,” Jerry said. “We’ll start out. Maybe
we can find a hotel or a farm house where we can
buy some lunch.”</p>

<p>Tired and discouraged, hungry and thirsty, the
boys started off to tramp up along the river bank.
It was in strange contrast to the manner in which
they had arrived the evening before.</p>

<p>Their course lay partly through meadow land
and partly through the woods, for the river was
winding in its course. The sun beamed down hot
and the journey was anything but a pleasant one.
But the boys with grim determination did not mind
the discomforts. They wanted to find their boat
and they were willing to make any sacrifices to get
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>They had walked for an hour without seeing
a sign of habitation or meeting a person. But,
about noon, as they came around a sharp turn,
where the river flowed between two rather high
hills, they spied a farm house, which, from the
extent of land surrounding it, and the number of
out buildings seemed to belong to a man of means.</p>

<p>“Well, that looks as if there was something to
eat there, at any rate,” spoke Bob. “Hurry up,
fellows, I’m nearly starved. Have any of you got
any money? I’m broke.”</p>

<p>Ned had only a little change, but, fortunately
Jerry had several bills in his pocket.</p>

<p>“We don’t look very presentable to go up to
a man’s house on Sunday,” said Ned. “But beggars
can’t be choosers.”</p>

<p>The boys had on old suits which they donned
as they expected to tramp through the woods.
Their good clothes were on the boat. Then too,
the jaunt along the river had not improved their
appearance as they were rather begrimed.</p>

<p>“Let’s scrub up a bit before we make an appeal
for help,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” agreed Bob, and all three went
down to the edge of the river. They washed
the mud off their shoes, scrubbed their faces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hands, drying them on their pocket handkerchiefs,
to the detriment of the linen, and then they brushed
the dirt and cobwebs from their clothes with
bunches of grass.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Jerry when the toilets
were completed. “We’re not exactly dressed
for a party, but I guess it’s some better than we
were.”</p>

<p>They approached the farm house from the front.
Bob had suggested going in the back way, but Ned
insisted they were not tramps, but travelers willing
and able to pay for a meal, so it was decided
to approach in style.</p>

<p>Jerry rang the bell. In a little while an aged
colored man answered. He was all smiles as he
came along, but, as he opened the glass paneled
portal the boys could see a frown appear on his
face.</p>

<p>“Marse Johnson done give p’ticklar orders that
all tramps an’ beggars done got t’ go t’ th’ back
part this establishment!” said the negro.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s that got to do with us?” asked
Jerry. “Tell Mr. Johnson we wish to see him at
once.”</p>

<p>“Well I mus’ say you’s th’ most imperterlitest&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind!” exclaimed Jerry. “Just tell
Mr. Johnson that we are from Cresville. He’ll
understand.”</p>

<p>The colored man hesitated a moment. Clearly
he was puzzled by Jerry’s confident manner.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Jerry to Bob and Ned, waving
his hand toward some porch chairs.</p>

<p>That seemed to settle it in the negro’s mind.
Any one who assumed so much must be an expected
guest he reasoned even though the clothing of the
boys betokened them to be unlike the usual run
of visitors.</p>

<p>Somewhat apprehensive of what their reception
might be the boys waited. They heard the footsteps
of the colored man go echoing down the hall.
The big dog, seemingly satisfied that all was right,
had resumed his sleep.</p>

<p>The boys heard someone coming along the
gravel on the walk at the side of the porch. They
looked up, expecting to see the master of the house
approaching. They beheld a little man with a
round shining bald head, and a fuzz of white
whiskers around his chin. Though long past middle
age, he came along with sprightly steps. No
sooner had he caught sight of the boys than his
walk became a run, and he fairly bounded up on
the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well of all things!” he exclaimed. “Who
would have thought to see you here. My but I’m
glad to see you. Welcome, fellow fire-fighters!”</p>

<p>The boys rose from their chairs, rather puzzled
over the little man’s words and actions. He began
shaking hands with them, though, as Bob afterward
confessed he was doubtful about engaging in
the operation, as he thought the man was a mild
lunatic.</p>

<p>“Well, well, but I am glad to see you!” the
little man went on. “I’m awfully glad you came.
You’re just in time for dinner. Come right in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, friends of yours, Henry?” asked a voice
from the doorway, and the boys turned to see a
tall stately gentleman coming out on the porch.
“You young gentlemen must excuse me,” the tall
man went on. “I did not understand Sambo’s
message. He said, but you must pardon me for
repeating it, but he said there were some tramps out
here. But I did not dream there were some old
friends of Cousin Henry’s. I am very pleased to
meet you.”</p>

<p>All of which was more and more puzzling to
the boys.</p>

<p>“Friends of mine! I should rather say they
were!” exclaimed the little man. “These young
gentlemen,” he went on, “are honorary members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the Towanda Fire Department, of which I am
the only living charter member!” and he threw
back his shoulders proudly.</p>

<p>“That’s what they are,” he went on. “You
should have seen them and their steam boat at the
Dudley fire. They saved the day, that’s what they
did. We elected ’em on the spot. I was there!
I ought to know! My, but that was a blaze!” he
exclaimed. “Me and the chief never forgot your
services. I’m general adviser of the department,”
he continued. “You saw me there?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Jerry, who, with the other
boys now remembered the little man who had been
so fussy to see that the ancient hand engine worked
well.</p>

<p>“Well, any friends of yours are friends of
mine,” said the tall gentleman. “Introduce me,
Henry,” which the only living charter member of
the Towanda Fire Department proceeded to do
with old fashioned courtesy.</p>

<p>“You’re just in time for dinner,” spoke Mr.
Johnson. “I shall only be too proud to have you
join us. My cousin has told me, several times of
your assistance at the big fire. I have often desired
to meet you. My cousin came over on a
visit this week. Fortunate that you should have
known of it and followed him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“We didn’t. It was all an accident,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>Then, in a few words he explained what had
happened, relating the theft of the motor boat,
and how it happened they were only chance visitors.</p>

<p>“Remarkable, remarkable!” exclaimed Mr.
Johnson. “I never heard anything like it. Now
come right in. My wife and daughters will be
delighted to meet you and hear that story.”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously, at the suggestion of meeting
ladies, the boys glanced at their clothes.</p>

<p>“Now, now, no apologies!” exclaimed Mr.
Johnson. “I’ll explain everything. You must
take dinner with me. It is almost ready. Sambo,
show the young gentlemen to the bath room, and
tell Mary to put on three extra plates. Delighted
to have the opportunity of dining with you,” Mr.
Johnson added, bowing to the boys.</p>

<p>“Talk about luck!” said Bob, when they were
left alone. “Say, we’re right in it. Who’d ever
thought our helping at that fire would have brought
us a meal just when we needed it most.”</p>

<p>The other boys were equally impressed by the
strange coincidence, and voted it a most fortunate
thing that they should have come to the house
where cousin Henry was stopping. They were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the more inclined to thank their lucky stars when
they saw the bountiful meal that was set upon the
table half an hour later.</p>

<p>The boys had to tell their story over again, with
all the details, for Mrs. Johnson, and her two
daughters, both young ladies were much interested,
and asked scores of questions.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you heard or saw a motor
boat going up the river, did you?” asked Jerry of
his host.</p>

<p>“Not personally,” replied Mr. Johnson. “But
I did hear Sambo say something about hearing a
queer whistle out on the water sometime ago.
Maybe that was it. I’ll let you ask him.”</p>

<p>The colored man was summoned, and proved to
have even better news. He said he had been down
on the river bank several hours previous and had
seen a boat, that answered every description of the
<i>Dartaway</i>, going up at full speed.</p>

<p>“Could you see who was on board?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“’Peared laik there was two men on her,” said
Sambo, “a little one an’ a bigger one.”</p>

<p>“We’d better start right off after them,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“I can’t let you go so soon,” protested Mr.
Johnson. “Perhaps I can be of some assistance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
you. I have a number of rowboats, and you’re
welcome to one or more of them. You can row
up stream, which is better than walking, though
it’s not so fast as your craft goes. Then, if I
were you I’d send dispatches to the principal cities
and towns along the river, asking the police to keep
a look-out for your boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Jerry. “I never
thought of that. Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better send a telegram home to
your folks telling them you will be delayed,” went
on Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>“Is there a station near here?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I will send Sambo over to town with the messages
this afternoon,” Mr. Johnson said. “In the
meanwhile make yourselves to home here, and rest
up. You’ll have hard work ahead of you I’m
afraid before you get your boat back. We have
heard rumors lately of a gang of thieves that have
infested this neighborhood, especially along the
river. Maybe some of them have your craft.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>FINDING THE DARTAWAY</small></h2>


<p>Right after dinner each of the boys wrote a
message home, and the colored man drove off with
them to the village about five miles away. Then,
having recovered from their fatigue, the boys went
to look at Mr. Johnson’s collection of craft. They
found he had several large rowboats, and they selected
one which two could pull, while a third person
in the stern could steer. It was rather a heavy
craft, but it was large and roomy, and on a pinch
they could sleep in it at night.</p>

<p>“This will be just the thing to make the search
in,” said Jerry. “Could we take her for three or
four days?”</p>

<p>“As long as you like,” said Mr. Johnson heartily.
“Just keep it and use it until you find your
boat, and you can then tow it back. Now come
into the house. I want to pack up some lunch for
you, and give you some blankets to camp out with,
since you are determined to start to-night.”</p>

<p>Having packed some provisions in the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
taking along a pot to make coffee in, a supply of
the commodity and a small oil stove, some kerosene,
and a lantern, the searchers started off.</p>

<p>They camped out under a big tree at dusk and
ate with good appetites in spite of their gloomy
spirits and then, having built a fire on the bank,
they prepared to spend the night.</p>

<p>“Forward again!” cried Jerry when after
breakfast the simple camp outfit had been packed
into the boat. At noon they came to a small village
where they stopped for lunch, and to stretch
their weary legs.</p>

<p>There they learned that the <i>Dartaway</i> had
passed early the previous afternoon. It had made
a short stop for gasolene. Of the dealer in the
fuel the boys learned that two rough looking men
were aboard the craft. Neither of them had said
anything to give a clue to their identity.</p>

<p>It was about three o’clock, when, as the boys
were rowing in a wide stretch of the river, Jerry,
who was at the tiller ropes, cried:</p>

<p>“Hark! Cease rowing! I hear something!”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned rested on their oars. The sound
of puffing was borne to them on the wind which
was blowing up stream.</p>

<p>“It’s a motor boat!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Or an automobile,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Automobiles don’t run along the river,” said
Jerry. “There’s no good road within a mile of
the stream, Mr. Johnson said. It’s a motor
boat.”</p>

<p>“But it’s coming up stream,” said Bob. “It
can’t be our boat.”</p>

<p>“Unless it went down past us in the night,” remarked
Ned. “But we’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer sounded the puffing of the
engine. There was no doubt that it was a motor
boat and that it was coming up stream rapidly.
The boys rowed enough to keep their craft from
drifting, and, five minutes later the oncoming boat
hove in sight.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>Terror</i>!” exclaimed Ned and Jerry
at once, as they recognized the Cresville police boat.
“Well, if this isn’t good luck,” Jerry went on.
“<i>Terror</i> ahoy!” he shouted making a megaphone
of his hands.</p>

<p>In answer there came three sharp toots from
the whistle of the gasolene craft, and her course
was changed to send her over towards the boys.</p>

<p>“Did you come for us?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not unless you are the burglars we’re after,”
replied Chief Dalton, who was in the bow, and who
recognized the boys.</p>

<p>“Burglars?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what,” replied the chief of the Cresville
force. “We’re out on business this trip.
But what’s the matter with you? Got tired of
your new boat so soon?”</p>

<p>Jerry quickly explained what had happened.
The chief was much surprised. The <i>Terror</i> had
been stopped and, at the invitation of the police
official, the boys came into the motor boat. There
were several policemen aboard and the engineer.</p>

<p>“Shall we tow our boat?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Better leave it tied to the bank,” said the
chief. “I want to make all the speed I can.
We’ll pick it up on the way back, that is if you
boys want to come along with us.”</p>

<p>“We sure do,” said Jerry. “We’d like to
have your help in finding our boat.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can kill two birds with one stone,”
the chief replied. “There was quite a robbery at
Northville last night, and they telegraphed for me
to help. The thieves got away in a motor boat,
it seems.”</p>

<p>“Northville,” said Jerry. “That’s the very
place we stopped for lunch, where the gasolene
man said he saw our boat. Who was robbed?”</p>

<p>“Why they broke into the general store there,
and got away with about a thousand dollars in cash
that was in the safe from the Saturday night sales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
They haven’t much of a police force in the town,
and they asked me to help ’em out.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the same men who stole our boat
robbed the safe,” ventured Ned.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be a bit surprised,” came from
Chief Dalton. “But we must get a hustle on.
I’ll tow your rowboat over to shore and you can
tie her up. Then we’ll keep on up the river.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Mr. Johnson’s boat having
been safely moored, the boys were on their way up
stream in a much speedier fashion than they had
been proceeding since the loss of their craft. A
good lookout was kept for any sight of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“I’ll land ’em yet,” the chief said. “They
can’t go much farther as the river gets too shallow.
I only hope they stick to the boat to the last. If
they strike across country it will be hard to find
them.”</p>

<p>All the afternoon the <i>Terror</i> chug-chugged on
her way. The boys forgot their anxiety over the
loss of their boat, and did not think of their fatigue
in the excitement of the chase.</p>

<p>It was about six o’clock, when, having made a
short stop at a little village, to learn that the <i>Dartaway</i>
had passed not more than an hour before, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
chief, who was steering, held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>Everyone on the <i>Terror</i> listened intently. From
the broad stretch of water before them, borne on
a wind which had shifted and was coming down
the river, the faint puffing of a motor boat could
be heard.</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Dartaway</i>!” exclaimed Jerry. “I
know her exhaust!”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re right!” said the chief grimly.
“Put a little more speed on,” he said to the engineer,
and the <i>Terror</i> leaped ahead under the influence
of more gasolene and an advanced spark.</p>

<p>A minute later they rounded a turn in the river
and saw the <i>Dartaway</i> just as her engine came to
a stop.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>READY FOR A CRUISE</small></h2>


<p>“They’re slowing up!” cried Jerry. “They’re
going to stop! We’ll get ’em now!”</p>

<p>Sure enough the <i>Dartaway</i> was slackening speed.
She was headed toward shore. The <i>Terror</i> was
gaining rapidly now. Chief Dalton stood up and
drew his revolver in preparation of capturing the
motor boat thieves.</p>

<p>But now the <i>Dartaway</i> was so near shore that
the men in her could almost leap to the bank.
They could be seen turning the wheel so as to throw
the craft parallel with the shore.</p>

<p>“They’re going to jump! We’ll lose ’em!”
cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go,” advised Bob. “All we want
back is our boat and we’ll get that.”</p>

<p>“That may suit you but it doesn’t me,” spoke
the chief of police grimly. “I’m after thieves
and I’m going to get ’em. They may not be the
men I want, but I’ll catch ’em just the same and
find out what they’re up to.”</p>

<p>But it looked as if the chief would have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
easy task to secure the motor boat thieves. For,
the next instant the pair leaped ashore, splashing
through the shallow water near the edge, and leaving
the <i>Dartaway</i> to continue on from the momentum
it had gathered.</p>

<p>With a whirl of the wheel the <i>Terror</i> was
headed toward shore. The chief and some of
his men prepared to make a quick landing.</p>

<p>“As soon as we get ashore I’ll have the engineer
put you out where you can get your boat,” the
chief said. “I’ve got to take after those fellows!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be with you as soon as we secure the
<i>Dartaway</i>!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” chimed in Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>With drawn revolvers the chief and his men
leaped toward shore, not waiting until their boat
was at the bank, but splashing through the water
as the thieves had done. As soon as they were
off the engineer of the <i>Terror</i> put his craft after
the boys’ boat.</p>

<p>In a little while the boys were aboard. They
soon satisfied themselves that no great damage
had been done, nor had anything of value been
taken. The thieves had evidently made themselves
at home, since the lockers were pretty well
emptied of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Terror</i> had put back to where the chief
and his men disembarked. Jerry set the engine
of the <i>Dartaway</i> going and soon found it was in
good order. Then, with Ned at the wheel, the
craft was turned around and headed back toward
where the thieves had jumped off. The boys
landed at about the same spot, and moored their
craft to a big tree.</p>

<p>“Look there!” exclaimed Jerry pointing to a
soft place in the mud on the river’s bank.</p>

<p>Ned and Bob glanced to where he indicated.
There in the soil were the marks of several large
foot-prints, and, conspicuous among them were
several in the sole of which was the mark of an
arrow, made in hob nails.</p>

<p>“The same man who took our boat stuck by
her until the end,” said Jerry. “Come on; let’s
go after the chief.”</p>

<p>Calling to the engineer of the <i>Terror</i> to have
an eye on their boat, the boys raced up the bank
and across the fields in the direction the police
posse had taken. As they started to run they
heard the sound of several revolver shots.</p>

<p>“They’re fighting!” cried Jerry. “Come
on!”</p>

<p>The boys needed no urging. They raced at
top speed in the direction of the shots. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
topped a small hill they could see in a valley below
them, two roughly dressed men running away
from the chief and his officers, who were a quarter
of a mile behind. As they watched they saw
the chief raise his revolver and fire twice into the
air.</p>

<p>“He don’t want to hit them, he’s only trying to
scare them into stopping!” cried Ned. “Come
on!”</p>

<p>Down the hill they raced, losing sight of the pursued
and the pursuers as they got below the hill
top. Still they could hear the shouts of the police.</p>

<p>The chase was now on in earnest. But it was
a stern one and likely to prove a long one. The
boys, in about five minutes, caught up to one of
the officers, and raced along with him. They
could hear the crashing of the underbrush as policemen
ahead of them raced through it. The
chief fired several more shots, but, the boat thieves
were not to be intimidated, and did not halt.</p>

<p>In a little while the boys came up to the chief.
He and the leaders were panting from the run.</p>

<p>“Have you lost them?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” said the chief. “They
turned into a swamp, and I’m not familiar enough
with it to make it worth while to go in. I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to get help from the local authorities and surround
the place. Then perhaps I can catch them.”</p>

<p>“Can we take any message for you?” asked
Jerry. “I think we’d better be going back. It’s
getting dark and I don’t suppose you can do anything
more this evening.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I can,” admitted the chief.
“I guess we’ll all go back. I’ve done my part in
this. Let the local constables finish where I left
off. I’ve run their men to cover now let ’em get
’em out.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow you got back our boat for us,” said
Jerry, “and we’re much obliged for that.”</p>

<p>Rather tired from the chase and the excitement,
the boys and the policemen retraced their steps
to the river. They found the two boats awaiting
them.</p>

<p>“Did they do any damage to your craft?”
asked the chief of Jerry.</p>

<p>“None that I could notice, but I didn’t make
a close examination,” replied the boy. “Come
aboard, you’ve never been on her.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied the chief, and, as his men
got into the <i>Terror</i>, he stepped into the <i>Dartaway</i>.
As he did so he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is she leaking?” asked
Jerry in alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but see what I found!” the chief said,
holding up a small object he picked from the cockpit
of the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“A diamond ring,” said the chief. “It is one
of several stolen, together with the money, from
the Northville store. There’s no doubt now but
that the motor boat thieves and those who robbed
the store are the same. My! But I wish I
could have caught them!”</p>

<p>He placed the ring in his pocket, and, after a
look over the boys’ craft, prepared to return to his
own.</p>

<p>“Maybe the thieves left some cash behind as
well as a ring,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” the chief made answer as he
went over the side. “Well, are you boys going
down the river?”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll put up at the hotel in Northville,
if there is one,” said Jerry. “It’s too long
a trip to go back to Cresville to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said the chief. “I
think I’ll do the same. Just come along with me
and I’ll see that you are accommodated with lodgings.
I’ll swear you in as my deputies,” he said
with a laugh, “and it won’t cost you anything.
Besides I may need your help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as the two boats were making ready for
the trip down the river there was a movement on
shore. The bushes parted and a roughly dressed
man, with what seemed to be a week’s growth of
beard on his face, stepped out.</p>

<p>“Can any of you gentlemen oblige a poor tired
wayfarer with a lift down this placid stream?” he
asked with a bow which took in both parties.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the boys started.
They wondered where they had heard those tones
before.</p>

<p>“Who are you and what do you want?” asked
the chief sternly. “They don’t deal very lightly
with tramps in these parts. You’d better clear
out. We’re police officers.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you. I am the Duke of Wellington,”
said the tramp in airy tones.</p>

<p>At that answer the chief gave a start, and then
tried to appear as if nothing had happened. But
Jerry who was watching intently, saw an almost
imperceptible sign pass between the chief and the
ragged man.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you’re the Duke, I suppose we’ll have
to accommodate you,” the chief replied. “You
can come in my boat if you want to.”</p>

<p>Then, to the no small astonishment of the policemen,
the tramp climbed aboard the <i>Terror</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which, with a throb of the engine started down
the river. The <i>Dartaway</i> put after her at full
speed.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say we’ve had plenty of excitement
for one spell,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And there may be more,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because of that tramp,” and Ned indicated
the one aboard the <i>Terror</i>. “There’s something
strange about him. Does he remind you of any
one?”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Jerry. “I was wondering
where I had heard that voice before. He’s
the tramp who was asleep on the hay barge. I
wonder what he’s doing around here, and so
friendly with the police.”</p>

<p>“There’s something behind all this,” observed
Ned. “We must keep our eyes open.”</p>

<p>The boys’ craft soon caught up to the police
boat which was more heavily laden, and the two
proceeded down the stream toward Northville.
It was after dark when they tied up at a dock, and,
making their boat snug proceeded to follow the
lead of Chief Dalton.</p>

<p>“Is it safe to leave our boat here?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied the officer. “I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to have a man on guard all night. I guess the
thieves won’t come back. Come ahead; we’ll go
to the hotel and have supper.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob walked on ahead with the main
body of policemen, but Ned, who lingered to get
from the locker a better coat than the one he was
wearing, the other boys having changed garments
before, found himself close behind the chief and
tramp who were walking up from the river together.</p>

<p>“Any luck?” Ned heard the chief ask the
ragged man in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve discovered the cave where they
hide the stuff,” was the cautious rejoinder. “It’s
about where&mdash;”</p>

<p>In his eagerness to walk softly and hear what
was being said, which perhaps he had no right to
do, Ned stepped on a piece of wood that broke
with a sharp crack. The two men turned suddenly.</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” the tramp spoke suddenly
in a loud voice, evidently for the benefit of any
listeners, “I have tramped many weary miles, and
have eaten scarcely anything. I am too ill to work,
and I don’t know where I am to sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>The jingling sound of money passing from the
chief’s hand to that of the tramp could be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you’d better clear out of here,” said the
police officer sternly. “It isn’t a healthy place
for tramps. If I catch you loafing around I’m
going to lock you up.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never catch me,” the tramp said with
a laugh as he moved away in the darkness.
“I’ll clear out.”</p>

<p>“Odd character,” the chief remarked turning
back to Ned. “Sometimes I feel sorry for those
fellows. Some of ’em are all right, but luck is
against ’em. Well, I expect you are hungry.”</p>

<p>“Oh I can eat a little,” replied Ned, puzzling
his brains over the strange scene he had witnessed.
But the chief was evidently not inclined to talk
about it, and Ned did not feel like asking.</p>

<p>In a little while the whole party was at the
hotel, where a meal was served. Then the boys,
having sent telegrams home, stating they were all
well and would be home the following day, went
to bed.</p>

<p>The next day they returned Mr. Johnson’s boat
and went home.</p>

<p>For a week after this the boys dug away at their
examinations and, though they were, perhaps,
thinking more of what they would do in vacation
than about their studies, they all managed to pass
with good averages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now for a long cruise down to Lake Cantoga!”
exclaimed Jerry on the afternoon of the
last day of school. “I’m going to tie a stone to
my books and anchor ’em out in the middle of the
river. When I want ’em again I hope the fishes
will have eaten ’em up!”</p>

<p>The boys arranged to leave the Tuesday following
the last Friday at school. Bob and Jerry
were early down at the boathouse that morning.
Ned had promised to be on hand early but, for
some unaccountable reason was late.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s keeping him,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Here he comes now,” spoke Bob, “and he’s
running as if something had happened.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE STORE ROBBERY</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry as Ned
came down on the dock, his face quite pale, and,
evidently laboring under some excitement.</p>

<p>“Store&mdash;robbed&mdash;last&mdash;night!” panted
Ned.</p>

<p>“Whose store?” asked Jerry and Bob together.</p>

<p>“Father’s,” replied Ned. “They just discovered
it, and I came to tell you we’d have to delay
the trip. They got in last night, and got away
with about three thousand dollars in money and
jewelry. About one thousand was in cash. It’s
a big loss. Now I’ve got to go back and help
dad.”</p>

<p>“Who did it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what they’d like to find out, Chunky,”
said Jerry. “I don’t s’pose the burglars left
their cards, with their addresses on, behind them.”</p>

<p>“Great excitement! Terrible! Awful! Big
robbery! ’Bout a million loss! General alarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
sent out! Get the detectives to work! Send for
blood hounds! Notify the sheriff and start a
hunt! This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened!”</p>

<p>The boys turned to see whence the torrent of
words proceeded.</p>

<p>“I might have known it was Andy Rush,” said
Jerry. “Is there anything else, Andy? Haven’t
you forgotten something?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! I forgot to tell you. I have a clue
to the thieves!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried all the boys at once.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” said Andy, growing more calm
as the others grew excited. “I went over the
place as soon as I heard of the robbery, and I got
the clue. I’m going to be a detective some day.
You just keep your eye on me.”</p>

<p>“It’s all we can do to keep track of what you
are saying,” said Ned, “let alone what you are
going to do. But tell us about it. I’m interested.”</p>

<p>“Let Ned tell us of the robbery first,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>This was voted a good idea, and Ned related
how, when his father’s department store was
opened in the morning, it was discovered that the
safe had been blown open, and the money and jewelry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
stolen. In addition the thieves had carried off
some solid silver tableware, and a few rolls of
valuable silk.</p>

<p>“How did they get in?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s the funny part of it,” replied Ned.
“There’s no trace of anything being forced, not
a door or window is disturbed, as far as we can
learn.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re wrong,” said Andy
calmly. “That’s where my clue comes in. I
know how they entered.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you tell the police about it?”
demanded Ned somewhat indignantly.</p>

<p>“Because no one asked me to,” answered Andy.
“I wanted to tell you, but I couldn’t find you so I
came here, as I thought you’d be starting on the
trip.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can tell me now, Andy,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I can explain it better if we go up to the
store,” Andy answered. “I want to show you
just how it was.”</p>

<p>“We might as well go there,” came from Jerry.
“We will not undertake the trip to-day. To-morrow
or next day will do as well. Besides,
maybe we can help your father, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to spoil your fun,” interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Ned. “But I’ve got to stay home for a few
days anyhow. You could go on without me.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going,” said Bob stoutly.</p>

<p>“No indeed,” chimed in Jerry.</p>

<p>The boys talked of nothing but the robbery
as they started back towards Cresville, having
locked the boat up. When they got to Mr.
Slade’s store they found a big crowd about the
place. They elbowed their way through the
throng and were about to enter, when a little man
with a small bunch of whiskers on his chin stopped
them.</p>

<p>“Here, where you boys goin’?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Inside,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess not, young man. I’m a deputy constable,
sworn in special t’ maintain order an’ not to
let anyone inside. I’m goin’ t’ do it, tew, an’ you
can bet your bottom dollar on it,” and the little
man threw back his coat and displayed a big tin
star.</p>

<p>“Who swore you in?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Chief Dalton, that’s who, an’ I’ll arrest ye,
if ye make any more threatenin’ moves.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s my father’s store, and these are
friends of mine,” said Ned. “We want to go
in.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed the little deputy excitedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
“Look me in th’ eye, young man,” and
he pulled down the lower lid of the optic, placing
his face close to Ned’s.</p>

<p>“Looks all right,” said Ned, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Course it does; there nothin’ th’ matter with
that eye. But d’ye see anythin’ green in it?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. I cut my eye teeth some
time ago. Th’ last time I bought a gold brick
was so long ago I’ve forgotten it. You can’t
come it over me with any of your bunco games.
I believe ye’re part of th’ robber gang!”</p>

<p>The little deputy seemed so impressed with his
sudden idea that he was for at once putting the
four boys under arrest. He was only deterred by
the timely arrival of Chief Dalton, who had heard
the disturbance and come to see what it was about.</p>

<p>A word from him satisfied the constable, who
was one of a number hastily sworn in when it
was found what a crowd had gathered on hearing
news of the robbery, and he let the chums pass.</p>

<p>“Come ahead boys,” said the chief. “This
is a bad piece of work.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it has any connection with the
Northville robbery?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised. But I haven’t time
to talk. I’m trying to get a clue to start with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and I can’t seem to find any. I will before night
though.”</p>

<p>“Have you found where they got in?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered the chief. “Have you
heard anything, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Andy here seems to think he has a clue,” replied
the son of the store proprietor. “Tell him
about it, Andy.”</p>

<p>Andy blushed at the notice he was attracting
from the head of the Cresville police force.</p>

<p>“It was this way,” began Andy, when they had
all entered the store, which was deserted as far as
customers went, since Mr. Slade had ordered it
kept closed. “I was one of the first to arrive.
In fact I was an early customer. I wanted to buy
a new knife. So I was on hand when the head
clerk discovered the safe had been robbed. As
I’m going to be a detective, I decided I would
look for clues. I couldn’t find any around the
safe, so, when the clerk ran to the telephone to
call for the police, I wandered through the store.
No one noticed me, and I soon found myself on
the top floor. If you’ll come with me there I’ll
show you what I found,” and Andy started toward
the elevator.</p>

<p>“Oh can’t you tell us without waiting all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
while?” asked Ned who was growing impatient
as it really seemed Andy had discovered something.</p>

<p>“I can, but I can do it better if I point out
to you what I saw,” replied the boy. “Come
on.”</p>

<p>They followed him. The elevator carried
them to the top floor. No trade was done there,
as it was only a loft used for storing stock or
goods that were out of season. Andy led the way
through the half darkness to the rear. He
stopped in front of a window the sill of which
was thick with dust.</p>

<p>“Look there!” he exclaimed, pointing to something
in the soft and fluffy covering of the sill.
It was the print of a man’s foot.</p>

<p>“The mark of the arrow!” exclaimed Ned as
he bent over it. “The same man who stole our
boat robbed the store!”</p>

<p>The party gathered around the window, the
chief plainly excited at the unexpected clue. The
window had a large iron shutter on it, and this
was partly closed. The chief swung it open.</p>

<p>“There’s how the thieves got in,” said Andy,
pointing to a window in a building which was close
to Mr. Slade’s store in the rear. In this half-opened
casement a plank could be seen sticking, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
if some one had pulled it part way in and then left
it.</p>

<p>“There’s the bridge they came across on,” said
the chief. “Sure enough, Andy, you’ve discovered
what I could not. Come on, we’ll make positive
of it.”</p>

<p>Down stairs the party hurried, and around the
block to the building which abutted Mr. Slade’s
place in the rear. The structure contained stores
on the ground floor and apartments for several
families above. The top story was used as a
lodge room. There was a hallway at one side
of the store entrance, which gave access to the flats
above, and the door to it, as the chief learned was
never locked.</p>

<p>“They just waited their opportunity, went up
to the lodge room, stuck the plank across, and
came in the window,” said Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p>“But the window did not appear to have been
forced,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“They didn’t have to force it,” replied the
chief. “It has no lock on it.”</p>

<p>Up to the lodge room went the chief and the
boys, their entrance attracting no attention, as the
crowd, and most of Cresville’s idlers, were in
front of the robbed store.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” the chief said as he came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
door of the lodge room where it opened from the
hall. The portal had been forced. Through
the big apartment they tramped, and to the rear
where there were dressing and store rooms, seldom
used.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Andy, pointing to the dust covered
floor. “The mark of the arrow!”</p>

<p>There, plainly to be seen in the particles of dirt
were the footsteps of the mysterious man who had
escaped the police in the motor boat chase. The
marks were all over, showing that the one who
made them had tramped about the room making
his arrangements to rob the department store.</p>

<p>“There was some one with him,” the chief
said.</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>For answer the police official pointed to another
series of footprints in the dust. They were
smaller than those with the arrow mark, and bore
no distinguishing imprint.</p>

<p>The board, a plank about ten feet long, had
been dragged from a store room as the marks in
the dust showed. It had been drawn back only
part way, probably because the thieves had been
in too much of a hurry to leave after securing
their booty.</p>

<p>Following the chief the boys descended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stairs from the lodge room. The recent developments
put a new light on the matter, though the
boys did not see how they could lead to the detection
of the thieves.</p>

<p>“I must have a talk with some of the tenants
of this place,” the chief remarked.</p>

<p>They had reached the street by this time, and
the boys were about to leave. At that instant,
Mr. Nixon, Noddy’s father came running up to
the head of the police force.</p>

<p>“I want your help!” Mr. Nixon exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>“Noddy has been kidnapped!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>OFF TO THE LAKE</small></h2>


<p>“Kidnapped?” the chief exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes! Look here!” spoke Mr. Nixon, his
hands trembling with excitement as he extended
a piece of paper to the chief. “Noddy did not
come home all night. This morning I found this
in his room. It is terrible. You must help me
find him.”</p>

<p>The chief read aloud what was written on the
paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have taken your son away. If you want
his return say nothing but leave $1,000 under the
old oak tree on the river bank Friday night.</p>

<p class="noi right">“<i>The River Pirates.</i>”</p></div>

<p>“What do you think of that?” asked Mr.
Nixon, who was much excited.</p>

<p>“Um,” spoke the chief non-committally. “It’s
certainly very strange, Mr. Nixon. Noddy is
rather a large size to kidnap, but then you can’t
tell about criminals now. If you’ll leave this with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
me I’ll put some of my men right to work on it.
I’ve got my own hands full with this robbery.”</p>

<p>“Cresville certainly is coming into public notice,”
remarked Jerry in a low tone to Bob.
“First it’s a robbery, then Noddy Nixon disappears.”</p>

<p>“Kidnapped you mean,” interposed Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Jerry. “Noddy is no
more stolen away than I am.”</p>

<p>By this time the chief had walked off down the
street and Mr. Nixon went with him. The boys
remained together.</p>

<p>“But what in the world&mdash;” began Bob, when
Jerry stopped him with a wink, and made a slight
motion of his head toward Andy. He need have
no concern about Andy, as it developed, for that
youth, all afire to continue his detective work,
made a hasty excuse to the motor boys and hurried
off down the street after the chief.</p>

<p>“What’s that you and Chunky were saying
about Noddy?” asked Ned, who had not been
listening very closely to what his friends were talking
about.</p>

<p>“Jerry says Noddy was never kidnapped,”
spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he was,” put in Jerry. “I
happened to get a glimpse of the note Mr. Nixon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
had. It was partly printed and partly written,
but I’m a Dutchman if some of the handwriting
wasn’t Noddy’s.”</p>

<p>“How do you happen to be so familiar with his
handwriting?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I have a couple of specimens,” replied Jerry.
He drew from his pocket some slips of paper.
“One is that letter he wrote to us some time ago,”
said Jerry, “when he accused us of being responsible
for his running away from home the time he
rode off in his father’s auto. The other is that
bill he gave us for the fifteen dollars damage to
the rowboat. I picked it up after Ned threw it
at Noddy that Sunday.”</p>

<p>“And you think the writing in the kidnapping
note is like some of this?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” went on Jerry. “Besides,
who would kidnap Noddy? It’s true, his father
is wealthy, and able to pay a ransom, but don’t
you suppose Noddy would raise a cry if some one
tried to walk off with him?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did, but he might have been all
alone, and no one heard him,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Noddy doesn’t go out very much alone,” said
Jerry. “He has Bill Berry or some other crony
of his with him. Of course I’m only guessing
at it, but I wouldn’t be a bit surprised to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that Noddy’s disappearance had some connection
with this robbery.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you think Noddy
robbed my father’s store?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not quite that,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think Noddy has gotten in with a
bad gang. Some of them may have done this
robbery, and in order to get him out of the way,
for fear he might disclose something, they have
arranged this kidnapping hoax. He may be a
sort of captive, but he is among friends, I’m sure
of that.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell Chief Dalton this?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“And get laughed at for my pains,” said Jerry.
“I guess not. The chief has his hands full.
Perhaps he doesn’t believe Noddy is kidnapped,
but he will not say so. Mr. Nixon is one of the
biggest men in town, and the chief wants to please
him. So he’ll naturally fall in with Mr. Nixon’s
notions, and try to pretend he believes Noddy is
a captive.”</p>

<p>“Then what are we to do?” asked Chunky,
to whom the events of the last few hours came in
bewildering rapidity.</p>

<p>“I think the best thing for us to do is to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
camping just as we planned,” said Jerry. “I
don’t believe we can do much here, do you Ned?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t s’pose we can,” replied that youth.
“I did want to help dad, but as long as the stuff
is gone, and there is some clue to the thieves, I
don’t see that I can do any more. I’m for going
to camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go then,” said Bob. “I’m anxious
to get out in the woods where I’ll have an
appetite.”</p>

<p>“Good land! If you get up any more of an
appetite than you have now, Chunky,” said Ned,
“I don’t know what we’ll do with you. Can’t
you do something for it? Take Anti-Fat or
Padded Pellets for Peculiar People or something
that’s advertised in the backs of magazines.
It’s terrible to have such an appetite as you have.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d think so, sometimes,” remarked
Bob, as he looked at his watch and noted with
satisfaction that it was nearly dinner time.</p>

<p>“Come on down to my house for lunch!” exclaimed
Ned, divining Bob’s thoughts. “We can
talk matters over with dad, and see if it’s all right
to go.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade saw no objection to the boys making
the trip. His loss, while a heavy one, did not
cripple him, as he was a rich man. He thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the boys for their thoughtfulness in offering to
give up their pleasure trip to help him, but said he
did not see there was anything they could do.</p>

<p>“I guess the police will find the robbers if it’s
possible,” he added. “At the same time, if you
run across any clues on the lake you can let us
know. It seems to be the belief of the officials
that the robbers came and went in a boat. It
might have been a power or a sail boat. If it
happens to come on the lake with my valuables
and goods in, if you get them I’ll give you a reward,”
and he laughed for the first time that day.</p>

<p>“We may claim that reward,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>The boys made an early start the next morning
and, just as it was getting dusk they made a turn
in the broadening river, and, saw spread out before
them a big sheet of water.</p>

<p>Lake Cantoga was about fifteen miles long
and nine wide. There were several small islands
in it, and these, as well as the shores were favorite
spots for camping parties. The boys decided to
pick out one of the islands, but, as it was getting
dark, they could not see which one had not been
selected by other campers.</p>

<p>“I think we had better tie up along shore to-night,”
said Jerry, as he steered the boat out upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the lake. “We can look about better in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” said Bob, and Ned agreed.</p>

<p>As the <i>Dartaway</i> skimmed out from the shadows
of the shore she was seen by the owners of other
power boats, and greeted with the regulation three
whistles, to which Jerry replied.</p>

<p>“Guess they’re glad to see us,” he remarked.
“I had no idea there were so many here this year.
Maybe we’ll get a race.”</p>

<p>“That will be bully sport,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Going to camp here?” called the steersman
of one boat, which, as the boys could see, was evidently
built for racing, as there was little room for
anything but the engine.</p>

<p>“We figure on staying a week or so,” replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Glad of it,” replied the stranger. “My
name’s Smith, just plain John Smith. I’m camping
with some friends over on Coon’s Island.
Come over and see us when you get settled.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Jerry. “Are there any
other good islands to camp on?”</p>

<p>“There’s Deer Island, next to ours,” replied
Mr. Smith. “It’s a nice place, and hasn’t been
taken yet this year. Why don’t you come there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe we will,” replied Jerry. “We’re
going to tie up along shore for to-night.”</p>

<p>“Be pleased to have you put up at my shack,”
said the owner of the racing boat. “Got lots of
room.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, we’ll rough it for to-night,” said
Jerry. “We’ll look you up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, good-night,” called Mr. Smith,
and he opened up his boat and shot away in a
smother of foam. “Hope you go in the races,”
he called back, but he was too far away then to be
answered.</p>

<p>“Let’s have supper,” broke in Bob. “We
can talk about racing to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Jerry sent the boat under some overhanging
trees. She was made fast with bow and stern
lines, and then the boys, having lighted several
lanterns, and the big search lamp, prepared supper.</p>

<small>THE RACE</small></h2>


<p>The meal was eaten with appetites such as only
come from perfect health and a life in the open.
The boys filled themselves with no fear of future
consequences, and then, having let down the side
curtains, and seeing that all was snug, they pulled
out the bunks and went to sleep.</p>

<p>They arose about nine o’clock and, after a bath
donned their old clothes, for they anticipated rough
work in making camp, and prepared breakfast.</p>

<p>“Shall we use lake water or get some from a
spring for coffee?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Better hunt for a spring,” suggested Jerry.
“There’s a house up there,” and he pointed to
one quite a way from the river. “Maybe you
can get some there.”</p>

<p>Ned took a pail and jumped to the bank. As
he did so he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Sprain your ankle?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but look here!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>In an instant Jerry was at his side. Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
pointed to the ground close to a big tree to which
the bow line of the <i>Dartaway</i> was fastened.</p>

<p>There, in the soil was the imprint of a foot,
and in the center of it was the mark of an arrow
worked in hob nails.</p>

<p>“The man who robbed my father’s store!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“Or one with the same kind of shoes,” added
Jerry.</p>

<p>“There would hardly be two alike,” spoke Ned.
“I’m sure it’s the same one.”</p>

<p>“How can you be?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because I noticed that in the prints in the
dust on the window sill,” replied Ned, “that
there was a nail missing from the shaft of the
arrow. See, there is a nail out in this one,”
and he showed his companion that this was so.</p>

<p>Jerry bent closer to the print.</p>

<p>“You’re right!” he said. “This mystery is
deepening. But the prints might have been there
for some time.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ned. “It rained after we went
to bed last night. Not much, but a shower sufficient
to make mud. That print was made after
the rain.”</p>

<p>“Then the man was spying on us,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“He certainly was around here,” put in Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
who had come ashore. “Say, let’s send for Chief
Dalton.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can do a little detective work ourselves,”
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“I think it would be better to let the chief know
the man may be in this neighborhood,” spoke
Jerry. “Probably the information will not
amount to anything, but if something should happen
they could not blame us for keeping still.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back to Cresville?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I think it will do to drop him a note,”
said Jerry. “We can run to some post-office after
breakfast.”</p>

<p>The meal was hurried along and then, Jerry
having written a note to Chief Dalton, the lines
were cast off and the boat started for Eastport,
a little village about five miles off, where, as the
boys learned from the house where they got the
water, they could post letters.</p>

<p>They all went ashore at the post-office, which
was near the edge of the lake. Inside they found
quite a large crowd.</p>

<p>“Mail must come in early,” said Ned, for it
was hardly ten o’clock.</p>

<p>But it was not the arrival of the mail which had
attracted the throng. Instead they were all staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
at a big poster on the wall. On top the boys
saw in big letters:</p>

<p class="noic">REWARD!</p>

<p>Underneath was a lot of reading matter, which,
as the boys hastily perused it, they saw was an account
of the robbery of Mr. Slade’s store, and a
description of Noddy, who, it was stated, had been
kidnapped by a gang of river thieves. A reward
of $500 was offered for the arrest and conviction
of the thieves, while Mr. Nixon offered to pay a
like sum for the return of his son. The posters
were signed by Chief Dalton.</p>

<p>“Well, things are certainly doing back in Cresville,”
remarked Ned, as Jerry posted the letter.
“Mr. Nixon still thinks Noddy was stolen
away.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be fun if we could land the
thieves and Noddy too,” said Bob. “That would
be a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I guess if we landed the thieves Noddy would
not be far off,” spoke Jerry in a low tone. “I
don’t believe he would rob the store, but I’m
afraid he’s gotten in with a bad gang that would.
Hello, here’s another notice.”</p>

<p>There was one on the opposite wall. It was
not so large as the other, and was an announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that the following Saturday there would be a regatta
at the lake, in which there would be rowing,
sailing, swimming and motor boat races.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with us entering?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess we could,” commented Jerry. “I see
our friend John Smith is in charge. We can
probably find out all particulars from him. But
come on, we’d better be getting to the island or
we’ll find it taken.”</p>

<p>They learned from the postmaster how to get
to Deer Island, and, purchasing a few supplies,
and some butter, which they had neglected to
bring along, they set out.</p>

<p>Deer Island was about an hour’s run from the
village of Eastport, and as they neared it they saw
the boat they had met the evening before cruising
about.</p>

<p>“<i>Dartaway</i> ahoy!” exclaimed Mr. Smith, who,
as the boys could now see, was a man about
twenty-five years old.</p>

<p>“On board the <i>Tortoise</i>!” called back Jerry,
reading the name of Mr. Smith’s craft on the
bow.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you’d show up,” went on
Mr. Smith. “That’s a nice boat you got there.
Can she go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we think so,” replied Jerry modestly.</p>

<p>“Come on out and have a brush,” invited Mr.
Smith, running up along side. The boys saw his
craft was a powerful six cylindered one.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I guess we’d better get our
camp in shape first,” spoke Jerry. “Afterward
why perhaps we can have a race.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, you’re just in time for the regatta,”
went on Mr. Smith. “I’m in charge of
the motor boat contests. Let me enter you. The
prize is a silver cup.”</p>

<p>“Oh I guess you can put us down all right,”
went on Ned.</p>

<p>“What are the names?” asked Mr. Smith,
slowing down his craft and producing paper and
pencil.</p>

<p>Ned gave the names of his friends and his own,
and Mr. Smith jotted them down. “I’ll send you
an entry blank this afternoon,” he said, “and you
can fill it up. I’ll show you over the course whenever
you like. Good-bye, I’ve got to run over
for the mail,” and, opening the throttle, he sent
his boat ahead in a smother of foam while the
cylinders fairly thundered with the explosions.</p>

<p>“Guess we wouldn’t have much chance with
him in the race,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t know,” Jerry said. “The <i>Dartaway</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is a pretty fast boat. I’ll not give up until
we’re beaten.”</p>

<p>The boys found Deer Island a pleasant place
to camp. There were no parties on it yet, though
it was big enough for several. There was a natural
harbor, in a little cove, and some one had
built a small dock, and a boathouse, with merely
a roof and no sides, where the <i>Dartaway</i> could be
kept.</p>

<p>“Say, this is all right,” commented Ned.
“This is going to be jolly sport.”</p>

<p>The boys spent a busy morning. They set up
the tent, made up the cots, and took the gasolene
stove ashore, as they decided to do their cooking
on land rather than in the boat, where quarters
were not any too large. This done they found
they had their appetites with them, and proceeded
to make a meal off canned stuff.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. Smith came over with the
entry blanks, which the boys signed. Then, at
their new friend’s suggestion, they followed him
over the course, a triangular one of three miles
to each leg. Mr. Smith showed them where the
stake buoys were, and told them there was a clear
course, and plenty of water all around.</p>

<p>The day of the regatta could not have been
better had it been made to order. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
enough of a breeze to make sailing a pleasure,
but not enough to make the water rough. One
after another the different events were run off
until it came time for the motor boat contest.</p>

<p>There were ten craft entered, and a pretty sight
they made as they came up to the starting line.
Some of the boats were small and were given a
time allowance, while the larger ones were handicapped.
Mr. Smith’s boat, having the reputation,
as the boys learned, of being the fastest on
the lake was held back ten minutes. The <i>Dartaway</i>
with Jerry steering was placed on “scratchy”
time, that is starting off with the five boats judged
to be about on an even footing as regarded speed.</p>

<p>At the signal off went the boats having a time
allowance. Then the five, including the <i>Dartaway</i>,
got off together. Behind it came three rated
higher than the Cresville boys’ craft, and then
the <i>Giant</i>, a big boat, but with a smaller engine
than the <i>Tortoise’s</i>. Last came Mr. Smith’s craft,
and what a noise she made when her captain, who,
with two friends was running her, threw in the
high speed gear.</p>

<p>The race was on. Several power boats that
had not entered followed the contestants. The
Judge’s boat was also going part way over the
course. At the two outer buoys were stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
markers to see that the boats kept fairly to the
course.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes the boys were so
excited that they did not know whether they had
a chance to win or not. They kept pace with
the five boats in the company of which they started.
Jerry called to Bob and Ned to oil the engine
more, and then he put on a little additional speed.</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> seemed to leap forward, and left
the four boats behind. Seeing this their owners
increased their speeds, but Jerry, once he found
his craft was behaving finely, shoved the lever
over another notch or two, and soon was two
lengths ahead of the nearest of the four.</p>

<p>“Now to overhaul some of those ahead,” spoke
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>But the boys found they were slowly but surely
coming up to the leaders. Gradually they lessened
the space between them until the <i>Dartaway</i>
was in line with the first boat that got away.</p>

<p>But during this time the <i>Giant</i> and <i>Tortoise</i>
had not been idle. With their powerful engines
they were slowly cutting down the <i>Dartaway’s</i>
lead. For a while the two larger craft were in
line, but the <i>Giant</i>, finding the load too much for
her motors, dropped slowly to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so the <i>Tortoise</i>. In a smother of foam
she came on, the explosions roaring like a blast
furnace.</p>

<p>“He’s going to catch us,” shouted Ned, for
one had to yell to be heard above the roar of the
<i>Dartaway’s</i> engine which had been cut off from
the muffler to give a little more power.</p>

<p>“The race isn’t over yet,” called back Jerry,
shoving the levers over almost to the last notch.</p>

<p>Shortly after the first buoy had been passed
it became evident that the struggle for the winning
place was between the <i>Dartaway</i> and the <i>Tortoise</i>.
The others had either given up or were racing
among themselves for third and fourth prizes.</p>

<p>Rounding the second buoy the <i>Tortoise</i> passed
the <i>Dartaway</i>. It was to have been expected, but
the boys felt none the less chagrined. They had
hoped to win, but it was a big thing to go up
against a six cylindered craft with a four.</p>

<p>But Jerry had not given up yet. He had the
motor running at top speed now. The spark
had been advanced to the last notch, and the
cylinders were taking all the gasolene they could
use and not choke. Slowly but surely the <i>Tortoise</i>
drew away.</p>

<p>Suddenly there seemed to be some commotion
on board the leading boat. The two friends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Mr. Smith were seen to be busy over the motor.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Jerry. “One of his cylinders
is missing! We have a chance now.”</p>

<p>Sure enough the explosions from the <i>Tortoise</i>
were not so regular as they had been. One of
the cylinders had become clogged, and with five
going the engine worked unevenly.</p>

<p>“I think we can beat him!” exclaimed Jerry
grimly. He was not rejoicing over a contestant’s
misfortune, but it is on such mishaps as this that
motor boat and automobile races are won and lost.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Dartaway</i> was creeping up on her
rival. True it was but a slow advance, for there
were still five cylinders in the <i>Tortoise</i> against
her four. But the boys’ craft was doing nobly,
and their hearts beat high with hope.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was not going to give up without
a struggle. His two companions worked like Trojans
over the silent cylinder, but could not get
it to respond.</p>

<p>Then to the boys’ delight they found themselves
on even terms with the redoubtable <i>Tortoise</i>.
They were on the home stretch with less
than a mile to go. Already they could hear the
shouts, the cries and the applause of the watching
throngs, with which mingled the shrill whistles
of steam and motor boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Three minutes later the <i>Dartaway</i> had regained
the lead she had at the start, and thirty seconds
later had increased it. With two big waves rolling
away on either side of her cut-water she forged
ahead. Foot by foot she approached the stake
boat. With one last look back, which showed
him the <i>Tortoise</i> five lengths to the rear, Jerry
with a final turn of the wheel to clear the judges’
boat safely, <a href="#image01">sent the <i>Dartaway</i> over the line a
winner</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE COLLISION</small></h2>


<p>What shouting and cheers greeted the motor
boys as they slowed up their craft! The din
was deafening, augmented as it was by the shrill
whistles. The <i>Tortoise</i>, too, was received with
an ovation as she came over the line second, but it
was easy to see the victory of the smaller boat
was popular.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, boys!” called Mr. Smith as
he run his craft alongside. “You beat me fair
and square.”</p>

<p>He did not refer to the fact that one of his
cylinders went out of commission, but for which
fact he undoubtedly would have won. The boys
appreciated this.</p>

<p>The boys accepted their victory modestly, and
when they were sent for to go aboard the judges’
boat and get the prize Bob was for backing out,
while neither Ned nor Jerry felt much like going
through the ceremony.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em to send it over,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“That would hardly look nice,” replied Jerry.
“Come on, let’s all go together. It will soon be
over. Who’d have thought we could have butted
into the lime-light so soon?”</p>

<p>Having received the cup and stowed it safely
away Jerry was about to steer the <i>Dartaway</i> back
to Deer Island when he was hailed by Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>“Oh I say, you’re not going away, are you?”
asked the skipper of the <i>Tortoise</i>.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better be getting back,” replied
Jerry. “We have to straighten out the camp.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Mr. Smith. “The fun’s not
half over. Why there’s no end of good things
to eat over there. The committee made arrangements
to dine all contestants, and I’m sure you
boys are the chief ones after the handy way in
which you won that race. Really now, you must
stop a bit with us.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better,” said Bob, in a whisper.
“It wouldn’t be polite to refuse.”</p>

<p>“You were willing enough when it came to
sliding out of the cup proposition,” said Jerry,
“but now, when there’s something to eat, you’re
right on the job, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Guess we might as well,” put in Ned. “I
could dally with a bit of chicken myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, far be it from me to stand in the way,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
said Jerry, and, throwing the wheel around he
followed the <i>Tortoise</i>, which, with the other boats,
was making toward shore.</p>

<p>In the grove the boys found Mr. Smith had not
exaggerated matters when he said there “was no
end of good things to eat.” Large tables had
been spread under the trees and waiters were flying
here and there. The boys were a bit confused
by all the excitement, but Mr. Smith soon found
them, and introducing them to some of his friends,
got places for them at one of the best tables.</p>

<p>“I guess you boys will have plenty of chances
to race while you’re here,” said Mr. Smith. “I
hear a number of skippers want to try issues with
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll find us ready,” said Jerry.
“We’re rather new at the game, but we’ll do
our best.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk,” cried Mr. Smith.
“Play the game to the limit, no matter what it is.
I’d like another brush myself. Your boat can
certainly go.”</p>

<p>“I think you could beat us,” said Jerry frankly.
“If you hadn’t had that accident you would have
won.”</p>

<p>But now the dinner was almost over. Ice cream
was being served, and when every one had eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
their fill, there arose from the head table where
the regatta committee sat a cry of:</p>

<p>“Speeches! Speeches!”</p>

<p>Then came applause and cheers. The chairman
of the committee arose and, looking down toward
where the motor boys were sitting, began:</p>

<p>“I’m sure it would give us all pleasure to hear
a few words from the winners of the motor boat
race. They are newcomers to our midst, and, as
such we welcome them.”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried the crowd. “Speech!
Speech!”</p>

<p>For a moment the boys felt a sort of cold chill
go down their backs. It was the first time they
had been placed in such a position. Bob looked
at Ned, Ned looked at Jerry, and Jerry glanced
down at Bob.</p>

<p>“Say something, Jerry!” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; go ahead; talk!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait until I get you both back to camp!”
muttered Jerry, as he pushed back his chair and
arose.</p>

<p>His heart was beating fast and there was a
roaring in his ears. He was greatly embarrassed,
but he felt he must say something to show that
he appreciated the honor paid him and his comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sure my friends and I are deeply sensible
of this welcome,” he said. “We didn’t expect
to win the race, though we did our best. We’re
very glad to be here among you, and we hope
to continue the acquaintances we have made. And
I want to say that if one of Mr. Smith’s cylinders&mdash;I
mean if one of Mr. Cylinder’s smith&mdash;er&mdash;that
is if the boat Mr. Smith cylinders&mdash;I
mean owns&mdash;if his cylinder&mdash;er&mdash;that is if
his boat’s culander&mdash;cylinder&mdash;hadn’t cracked
Mr. Smith’s head&mdash;I would say if the cylinder&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What he means,” said Mr. Smith gallantly
coming to the relief of poor Jerry, “is that if I
hadn’t had the misfortune to crack the forward
cylinder I might not have been beaten so badly.
But I want to say that that’s all nonsense. It was
a fair race, and won fairly, and the <i>Dartaway</i> did
it. So I ask you to join with me in giving three
cheers for the owners.”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, and the
boys felt the blushes coming to their cheeks. Altogether
it was a jolly time, and one the lads never
forgot.</p>

<p>“We didn’t make any mistake coming here,”
said Jerry, who had taken his place at the wheel
as they started for their camp. “It’s almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
much fun as automobiling in Mexico or crossing
the plains.”</p>

<p>The boys were proceeding rather slowly as they
had not yet familiarized themselves with the lake
and their bearings, and they did not want to run
into anything.</p>

<p>For a while the <i>Dartaway</i> skimmed along, there
being no other craft near. The water lapped the
sides and broke away in a ripple of silver waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jerry threw out the gear clutch, and
began spinning the wheel around. At the same
instant Bob and Ned, who had been looking to
the rear, turned around and saw a big black shape
in front of them.</p>

<p>“Ahoy there! Schooner ahoy!” called Jerry.
“What do you mean by cruising about without a
light. You’ve no right to do that. Look out
there. You’ll foul us!”</p>

<p>The sound of feet running about on a deck
could be heard. Then there came a moment of
silence followed by a sudden jar and a grinding
crash.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE</small></h2>


<p>The shock threw the <i>Dartaway</i> back. Jerry
had already turned off the power, and was slowing
down for the reverse when the smash came. The
motor boat had fairly poked her nose into the
side of the schooner.</p>

<p>“Are we damaged?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” replied Jerry, seizing one of
the oil lanterns and holding it over the side of
the bow. He could see a big dent in the wooden
hull of the motor boat, and a larger one in the
schooner. The two boats were now drifting apart.</p>

<p>Aboard the schooner there was much confusion.
Several persons seemed to be talking at once.
Lights flashed here and there.</p>

<p>“Look out, I’m going to back away,” said Jerry
to Bob and Ned. “Is it all clear to the rear?”</p>

<p>He swung the search lantern so that the beams
cut a path of light aft.</p>

<p>“Nothing in the road,” sung out Ned.</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Dartaway</i> separated from the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the schooner. As she did so the stern of the
larger vessel swung over toward the motor boat,
and Bob, who was watching it gave a sudden cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is she going to hit us
again?” called Jerry, slowing up the engine.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Bob. Then lowering his voice
and crawling to where Jerry stood he whispered:</p>

<p>“This boat has the name of <i>Bluebird</i> on her
stern!”</p>

<p>At the same instant there came floating over
the water the sound of a voice from some one
aboard the larger craft.</p>

<p>“We’re sinking! Quick Bill! Get the boat
over and find me a life preserver. I don’t want
to drown!”</p>

<p>At the sound of the mysterious voice, coming so
plainly amid the stillness that followed the crash
the boys were startled.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that sound just like&mdash;” began Bob.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned Jerry in a whisper. “Wait
a while before you talk.”</p>

<p>“I tell you we’re sinking!” the voice went on.
“They rammed a hole clear through us. They
did it on purpose! They want to capture me!”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, you numbskull!” the boys heard
some one exclaim in reply. “You’ll be caught
quick enough if you don’t keep still. Do you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to give the whole thing away? Get below before
they flash that search light on the deck and see
who you are!”</p>

<p>Silence ensued, broken only by the sound of
some one moving about on the deck of the
schooner.</p>

<p>“Flash the light on ’em!” called Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry swung the big gas lamp around on its
pivot, and the blinding white glare illuminated the
schooner. The only person to be seen on deck
was a man at the helm, and, by the beams the
boys could see he was roughly dressed.</p>

<p>For an instant the steersman stood plainly revealed
in the beams. He wore nothing on his
head, but, as soon as the glare set him out from
the darkness he caught up from the rail a slouch
hat which he pulled over his eyes, screening the
upper part of his face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” demanded
Jerry with a pretense of anger, as he wanted to
hear the man’s reply. “Couldn’t you see our
boat?”</p>

<p>“If I could have d’ye s’pose I’d a stood here
an’ let ye run int’ me?” the man asked in answer.
“Them gasolene boats is gittin’ too dangerous.
I’ll have th’ law on ye for this.”</p>

<p>“What about the law requiring sailing boats to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
carry lights at night?” asked Jerry. “I guess
if there’s going to be any suing done we can do
our share.”</p>

<p>The steersman made no answer. The wind
freshened just then, and the schooner gathered
way. The helmsman put her about, and she
heeled over as the breeze came in powerful gusts.</p>

<p>While the after part of the sailing vessel was
still in the zone of the search light the boys observed
a second figure aboard. It came up the
companionway leading down into a small cabin.</p>

<p>“Git down there!” the steersman exclaimed.
“They’ll see you!”</p>

<p>The figure disappeared suddenly. The boys,
seeing it would be no further use to argue with
the surly skipper, put their boat on her course
and resumed the trip to the island. They found
beyond a slight loosening of the engine, due to
the shock, no damage had resulted.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we ran into something that
time,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Two things I would say,” put in Jerry. “If
that mysterious voice, the steersman tried to hush,
wasn’t that of Noddy Nixon’s I’ll eat my hat.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say the same thing,” added
Bob. “I was sure I recognized it.”</p>

<p>“Then he isn’t kidnapped at all,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never believed he was,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“I wonder who the other person was,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>“I have an idea it was Bill Berry,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“It didn’t sound like his voice,” interposed
Ned.</p>

<p>“If you noticed,” went on Jerry, “he talked
with two voices. When he spoke to Noddy his
tones and words were much different than when
he addressed us and threatened to have the law
on us. I’m sure it was Bill Berry.”</p>

<p>“Then those two are up to some mischief, I’ll
bet,” ventured Ned. “There must be some game
afoot when Noddy lets it be thought he is kidnapped,
and when we find him away off here in
a schooner.”</p>

<p>“There is,” spoke Jerry. “It’s the same game
that began with the reference to something ‘blue’
that Bill Berry made that day. It’s the same game
that we nearly discovered when we almost ran into
the <i>Bluebird</i>, and now we have the same schooner
away down here on the lake and we nearly sink in
consequence of hitting her, or of her hitting us,
for I believe they got in the way on purpose.”</p>

<p>“But what is the game?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s puzzling me,” replied Jerry.
“I’m inclined to think that the gang Chief Dalton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is after will be found to have some connection with
this vessel, and while I have only a mere suspicion
of it, I believe the robbery of Mr. Slade’s store
is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look out there! You’re going to hit me!
Keep to the left!” exclaimed an excited voice.</p>

<p>Jerry rapidly spun the wheel around and the
<i>Dartaway</i> veered to one side with a swish of water,
just grazing a rowboat with a man in it, that
loomed up dead ahead.</p>

<p>“Almost had me that time,” said the rower
pleasantly as the <i>Dartaway</i> slowed up. “It was
my fault though, I ought to have had a light.”</p>

<p>His frank admission of his error, and his failure
to abuse the boys for nearly colliding with
him, as most rowers would have done under the
circumstances, made the boys feel at ease.</p>

<p>“Sorry we caused you such a fright,” said
Jerry. “Can we give you a tow?”</p>

<p>He swung the search light about to illuminate
the rowboat. As he did so he gave an exclamation
of astonishment. The rower was none other than
the ragged tramp who had been rescued from the
hay barge, and who had been given a ride in
the <i>Terror</i> following the unsuccessful chase after
the motor boat thieves. He recognized the boys
at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh it’s you, my young preservers!” the
tramp said. “Well, we seem fated to meet at
odd moments. First you save my life, and then
you nearly take it from me. Well, it evens matters
up.”</p>

<p>“Can we tow you anywhere?” asked Jerry
again.</p>

<p>“Thanks, noble sir,” replied the tramp with
the same assumed grand air he had used when
talking to Chief Dalton. “I fain would dine,
and if you can take me to some palace where the
beds are not too hard, and where I could have a
broiled fowl, or a bit of planked whale, with a
sip or two of ambrosial nectar, I would forever
call you blessed.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you’re hungry?” asked Bob,
who had a fellow feeling for all starved persons.</p>

<p>“As the proverbial bear,” answered the tramp.
“You haven’t a stray cracker about your person,
have you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve got a couple of ham sandwiches,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well if you’re not at it again, Chunky,” said
Jerry. “Where’d you get ’em?”</p>

<p>“I put ’em in my pocket at the feed this afternoon,”
replied Bob, taking the sandwiches out
and passing them to the tramp, whose boat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
now alongside. “I thought they’d come in
handy.”</p>

<p>“As indeed they do,” the ragged man put in,
munching away at the bread and meat with right
good appetite. “I thank you most heartily.”</p>

<p>“If you care to come to our camp we can give
you something more and a little coffee,” said Jerry.
“You could also sleep under shelter. We have
a tent ashore you can use and we can sleep on
board the boat.”</p>

<p>“If it would not discommode you, I would be
glad of the opportunity,” the tramp said, dropping
his assumed manner and speaking sincerely. “I
was about to spend the night in the woods,” he
went on, “but I much prefer shelter. I have a
mission here, and while I am on it I have to rough
it at times. But I am almost finished.”</p>

<p>“Will you come aboard, or shall we tow you?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be as well to tow me,” replied
the tramp. “I have some things in my boat
I would not like to lose.”</p>

<p>The tow line was soon made fast to the <i>Dartaway</i>,
and the boys resumed their trip which had
twice been interrupted by accidents. They reached
the island in safety, and soon were preparing some
coffee and a light supper. The tramp fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
his boat to a tree that projected over the water,
and, then sat at the rough table the boys had constructed
under a canvas awning.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I have been presented to you
gentlemen,” said the tramp, as the night dinner
was about to begin. Jerry laughing, introduced
himself and his chums.</p>

<p>“Are you Aaron Slade’s son?” asked the tramp
excitedly, as Ned’s name was mentioned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>A QUEER MESSAGE</small></h2>


<p>“Aaron Slade is my father,” replied Ned,
wondering what object the tramp could have in
asking.</p>

<p>“The one who was recently robbed?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“Well if this isn’t&mdash;” began the tramp more
excited than before. “I must&mdash;no I must not.
Pray excuse me,” he went on, with an assumption
of his former grand air, “I must not refer to that.
It escaped me before I was aware of it. Pay no
attention to what I said. I was going to tell you
something, but the time is not yet ripe. Now let’s
fall to, for I’m still imitating the bear in the predilection
of my appetite,” and he attacked the food
with every evidence that he was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in surprise. Ned,
in particular, wondered what the tramp meant by
starting as if he intended to tell some secret and
then stopping. Seeing that their guest was not
observing him, Jerry made a gesture that indicated
the tramp might not be altogether right in his
head. In this view Bob and Ned coincided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not alarmed, however, as the man
did not seem to be dangerous. He was too busy
eating to talk, and the boys soon forgot their curiosity
in making away with the food, for the trip
across the lake had given them all appetites.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the tramp should sleep in
the shelter tent, while the boys made use of the
bunks on board the boat. It was nearly midnight
before they turned in, and the motor boys, at
least, slept soundly until morning.</p>

<p>As for the tramp he may have rested well, but
at any rate he was not a late sleeper, for, when
the boys crawled out of their comfortable beds
for a plunge into the lake they found he had
built a fire on shore and was boiling their tea
kettle over it.</p>

<p>“That’s very good of you, but you needn’t have
gone to that trouble,” said Jerry. “We have a
gasolene stove.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” exclaimed the ragged man.
“Water for coffee should always be boiled over
an open fire. It has more flavor.”</p>

<p>Thinking this was only one of the tramp’s odd
conceits the boys did not argue further with him.
They took their bath, their odd guest meanwhile
making coffee.</p>

<p>“If you’ll tell me where the bacon and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
things are I’ll finish getting this meal,” he called
to them where they were splashing in the lake.</p>

<p>“Shall we let him?” asked Jerry of his chums
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Guess he won’t poison the stuff,” said Bob.
“Besides it will be ready while we are dressing
and we’ll not have to wait.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Jerry called out directions how to
find the victuals, and soon the savory smell of
sizzling bacon and frying eggs was wafted over
the water. They had a breakfast fit for a king,
and complimented the tramp on his skill.</p>

<p>A little later the tramp proposed that the boys
take his rowboat and go fishing on the other side
of the island. They were doubtful about leaving
him in charge of the camp.</p>

<p>“I see you’re a little suspicious of me,” the
tramp said. “Well I don’t blame you. However
to show you that I’m all right read that.”</p>

<p>He held out a slip of paper, on which was
written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This man can be trusted. Henry Dalton,
Chief of Police, Cresville, Mass.”</p></div>

<p>“If the chief says you’re all right, I guess that’s
enough for us,” spoke Jerry, as he handed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
paper back. “We’ll take a day off and go fishing.
Don’t let any one come bothering around our
camp. We have reason to believe an enemy of
ours is on this lake. He would do us some harm if
he could.”</p>

<p>“There are enemies of mine, also,” said the
tramp. “But have no fear. I’ll look after
things.”</p>

<p>Getting some bait and fishing tackle the boys
started off in the tramp’s rowboat. They did not
take any lunch, as they planned coming back at
noon.</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s all right to trust him?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is,” replied Jerry. “That note
from the chief was genuine. I know his writing,
and the paper was the same as the chief uses in
his private office. I got a permit once from him
to carry a revolver. You remember, when we
made our first auto trip.”</p>

<p>Satisfied that their belongings had been left in
good hands, and were safe from any chance intrusion
from Noddy Nixon or his cronies, the boys put
in an enjoyable morning fishing. They made several
good catches, and when the sun indicated that
it was nearly noon, they rowed around the island
to camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope he has a good fire going so we can
cook some of these fish,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess he will be ready for us,” said Ned.
“He seems to be a willing worker.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the boys rowed to shore they
found their odd guest had built a fine fire in an improvised
oven, and was all ready to proceed with
cooking the fish. It was the best meal the boys
had eaten since coming to camp, and they had the
tramp to thank for the major part of it. The
ragged man proved he had a better appetite even
than Chunky, which is saying a great deal. The
fish were done to a turn, and the bacon gravy gave
them a most excellent flavor.</p>

<p>So heartily did all eat that they were too lazy
to do anything but lounge around after dinner.
They stretched out under the trees and before they
knew it the boys had dozed off.</p>

<p>Jerry was the first to awaken. It was about
three o’clock when he sat up, rubbing his eyes,
and, for a moment wondering where he was.
Then he saw the lake through the trees and remembered.
He looked around and saw Bob and
Ned still stretched out on the sward. The tramp
was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’s gone fishing,” thought Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“He’s a queer duck. I must take a look at our
motor boat.”</p>

<p>Slowly he walked to where the <i>Dartaway</i> was
moored. He saw she was riding safely. Then
he looked for the rowboat. It was nowhere to
be seen, though it had been tied close to the motor
craft.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s slipped away,” thought Jerry.</p>

<p>At that instant the sound of oars being worked
caught his ears. He looked up and saw, coming
around the point of the island, the tramp’s craft.
But the tramp did not seem to be in it. Instead
it held a fisherman, with a broad brimmed hat,
a corduroy coat, green goggles on, and a big
basket hung over one shoulder. In the boat two
poles could be seen, also a gaff sticking up.</p>

<p>“Some one has stolen his boat,” thought Jerry.
“Hi there!” he called. “Where you going?”</p>

<p>“Fare thee well!” called back the fisherman.
“I must away on my mission.”</p>

<p>“Come back with that boat!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why so? ’Tis mine,” came back the answer
over the waters as the fisherman rowed farther
out from shore. “Sorry to leave you in this
fashion, but my mission calls.”</p>

<p>“Why it’s the tramp!” exclaimed Jerry, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
recognized the voice of the ragged man in spite
of his queer disguise. “But where in the world
did he get that rig?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned, having
awakened and coming down to join Jerry.</p>

<p>“There goes our tramp,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>The tramp was now quite a distance out. He
stood up in his boat.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;in&mdash;your&mdash;coffee&mdash;pot!” he
called. “I&mdash;left&mdash;a&mdash;message!”</p>

<p>Then he sat down and began rowing hard.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, get the coffee pot!” cried Jerry.
“We must get at the bottom of this!”</p>

<p>He and Ned ran back to the tent. They found
the pot set in the middle of the table. Jerry threw
back the cover. Inside was a piece of birch bark,
on which was written in pencil:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where the <em>bluebird</em> spreads her wings, there
you’ll find the stolen things. Search her deep,
and search her through, you will find I’m speaking
true.”</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>SEARCHING FOR THE SCHOONER</small></h2>


<p>“Well if this isn’t mystery and more of it!”
exclaimed Bob. “What in the world does it all
mean, and the tramp going off in this fashion?”</p>

<p>The boys gathered close together, their heads
bent over the mysterious message on the birch
bark.</p>

<p>“Let’s call to him to explain,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s too late,” said Jerry. “He’s too far
out. Besides I don’t believe he’d come back.
Anyhow I think I know what the message means.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ned and Bob in a chorus.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it plain enough?” asked Jerry with a
smile. “If Andy Rush was here he’d have half
a dozen explanations.”</p>

<p>“Let me read it once more?” came from Ned.</p>

<p>“‘Where the <em>bluebird</em> spreads her wings, there
you’ll find the stolen things. Search her deep and
search her through, you will find I’m speaking
true.’”</p>

<p>“Why of course!” exclaimed Bob. “It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
be the schooner <i>Bluebird</i> he’s referring to, and he
means your father’s things will be found in her,
Ned. It’s as plain as the nose on your face.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Ned. “Is that what you
make of it Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure. That part is easy enough. What does
puzzle me though is that tramp. I can’t quite
make him out. He’s a funny character, and his
latest effort is stranger than any since his adventure
on the hay barge. I wonder how he knew
there was stolen stuff aboard the <i>Bluebird</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well that seems simple enough to me,” spoke
Ned. “He’s probably been a criminal in his time,
and knows some of the crooks who robbed my
father’s store. In some way he found out they
had the stolen stuff on the schooner, and he wanted
to let us know to pay for our favors to him. You
remember how excited he got when he found out
my name was Slade.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right as far as it goes,” said
Jerry, “but you’ll never get me to believe that
tramp is either a criminal or one who travels with
thieves. He’s a different character altogether.
You’ll see I’m right. He may have found out
where the stolen stuff is, but it was in some other
way than being a companion of the thieves.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe, you’re right,” came from Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
“That part can be settled later. The main thing
is to find the <i>Bluebird</i> and see what there is
aboard.”</p>

<p>“Which isn’t going to be such an easy thing
as it sounds,” Jerry remarked.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, it may be a simple matter to locate the
vessel, as the lake is not very large, but when we
get to her have you thought of what we will do
with her?”</p>

<p>“Go aboard, of course, and demand my father’s
goods and money,” said Ned boldly.</p>

<p>“You seem to forget there is a difficulty in the
way,” Jerry went on. “The men who stole the
stuff, provided it is aboard the ship, are not likely
to let us come over the side as if we were on a
visit, and search for incriminating evidence. Then,
too, there is Noddy, and he is not likely to welcome
a call from us. No, I think we’ll have
our hands full in getting aboard the <i>Bluebird</i>.”</p>

<p>“What would you advise?” asked Bob, as
both he and Ned had come to regard Jerry’s
ideas as being a little better than their own on
important matters.</p>

<p>“I think it would do no harm to make a search
and find where the <i>Bluebird</i> is lying,” said Jerry
after a little thought. “Then, perhaps we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
decide on a plan of action. It’s a sort of following
the old recipe of making a rabbit pot-pie,&mdash;to first
catch the rabbit.”</p>

<p>The other boys agreed this was the best idea.
They watched the boat with the tramp-fisherman
growing smaller and smaller as he rowed out on
the lake, and puzzled more than ever over the
queer character.</p>

<p>“Well, shall we start right away?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would do any good,” said
Jerry. “Let’s get ready for supper, and this
evening we can take a run out on the lake. We
probably will not discover anything, but it will
be fun, and we may gain a clue.”</p>

<p>Shortly after sunset, the evening meal having
been finished, the boys made the <i>Dartaway</i> ready
and started away from camp. The lake was alive
with power and other boats and the boys met a
number of new acquaintances they had made at
the luncheon following the winning of the prize.
They speeded back and forth until dusk, and then
accepted an invitation of a party that was bound
for one of the resorts on the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>They spent some time there and when they
reached their island dock and made a landing it
was as dark as pitch. The boat was made fast
to the wharf and then, lighting some oil lanterns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the boys walked up to their camp, which was a
little way from shore.</p>

<p>As the gleam of the lamps fell on the place
Jerry who was in the lead uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>“Some one has been paying us a visit!” he
said. “And they haven’t been friends of ours
either.”</p>

<p>This was soon evident, for the camp was topsy-turvy.
The shelter tent was pulled down, the
utensils and camp stuff were scattered all about,
and the place looked as if a small cyclone had
struck it.</p>

<p>“I wonder who did this?” came from Ned.
“I’d like to get hold of them for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe this tells,” said Jerry, taking up a
piece of paper from the planks that served as a
table. The scrap had evidently been placed where
it would be easily seen. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You had better clear out of here before something
worse happens to you and your boat.”</p></div>

<p>“Who signs it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It has ‘The River Pirates’ at the bottom,”
said Jerry, “but I’d be willing to bet a new hat
against a cookie that it’s Noddy Nixon’s writing.”</p>

<p>“Then the <i>Bluebird</i> has been here in our absence,”
said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks so,” admitted Jerry. “Now let’s see
if any great damage has been done.”</p>

<p>They made a hasty examination, but beyond
tearing up the camp, and upsetting things, nothing
appeared to have been stolen or seriously damaged.
It seemed that the visitors merely wanted
to annoy the boys.</p>

<p>There was nothing much that could be done
until morning, so the boys, seeing that the <i>Dartaway</i>
was securely made fast, went to sleep on
board. They rested undisturbed until morning.</p>

<p>“Now to hunt for the mysterious schooner!”
exclaimed Ned after breakfast. “Do you know
I have a good scheme?”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“We ought to disguise ourselves,” went on
Ned. “If we go hunting for the schooner in
our motor boat the way we are now, they can
see us coming and get on their guard. We ought
to make up as fishermen, just as the tramp did,
and steam around slowly.”</p>

<p>“They know the boat by this time,” objected
Jerry.</p>

<p>“We can disguise her a bit by hanging strips
of canvas over the sides,” went on Ned, “and
by taking the canopy off.”</p>

<p>“I believe that’s a good suggestion,” said Jerry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
“Then we could take the thieves by surprise.
Come on, we’ll see what we can do to the boat.”</p>

<p>By removing the awning, and putting strips
of dirty canvas over the bright clean paint on
the sides of the <i>Dartaway</i> the whole appearance
of the craft was changed.</p>

<p>“Now for ourselves,” said Bob. “We’ll wear
our oldest clothes.”</p>

<p>If the boys hoped to succeed with little effort
they were doomed to disappointment. They spent
all the morning cruising around the lake and did
not get a glimpse of the craft they wanted. They
did not go back to camp for lunch, having brought
some eatables with them. In the afternoon the
cruise was resumed, but with no better luck.</p>

<p>For three days the boys went forth every morning
disguised as fishermen, and came back at night
having had their trouble for their pains.</p>

<p>“This is getting tiresome,” said Ned, on the
evening of the third day. “We’re having no
fun out of this trip at all. Let’s let the thieves
go. I don’t believe they have any stuff on the
boat.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try one more day,” pleaded Jerry.
“We’ll go away down to the other end of the
lake.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed. They made an early start the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
next morning and in the afternoon found themselves
cruising around at the extreme southern
end of the lake. There the body of water narrowed
in one place because of an island close
to shore. It was a spot seldom visited, and there
were no camps in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look around the other side of
that island,” suggested Jerry, when his companions
proposed going home. “There might be a dozen
schooners there.”</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was headed through the narrow
channel. Jerry, who was steering, was proceeding
slowly, as he was in unfamiliar waters, and the
channel seemed rather shallow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the motor boat emerged from the
strait, the three boys could hardly help refrain
from uttering an exclamation. There, moored to
the shore, was the <i>Bluebird</i>.</p>

<p>“We’ve found her!” whispered Bob excitedly.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned Jerry. “Pretend to be
fishing while I work the boat nearer. Don’t look
at the schooner. They may be watching us.”</p>

<p>With swiftly beating hearts the boys listened to
the throb of the propeller that brought them nearer
and nearer to the <i>Bluebird</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>THE PIECE OF SILK</small></h2>


<p>“Are you going right up close?” asked Bob.
“Maybe we had better wait a while.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” said Jerry. “Just watch.”</p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> continued to approach the
schooner. In the stern Bob and Ned pretended
to be trolling. Jerry held the motor craft on her
course, going at first speed, and kept her headed
right for the sailing vessel.</p>

<p>“You’re going to bump!” exclaimed Bob in a
low tone, looking over his shoulder at Jerry.</p>

<p>The next instant the <i>Dartaway</i> hit the side of
the schooner with a resounding thump, but not
hard enough to do any damage, as Jerry, on the
alert, reversed the screw just in time.</p>

<p>“I told you we were going to hit,” said Bob
in reproachful accents, for he had nearly been
tossed overboard by the recoil when the motor
boat backed away from the <i>Bluebird</i> from the force
of the blow.</p>

<p>“That’s all right I meant to hit ’em,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Jerry coolly, as he caught hold of a rope that
hung over the schooner’s side. “I did it on purpose,”
he went on in a lower voice. “It will seem
as if it was an accident and we can get a chance
to see who’s aboard. That knock ought to bring
’em out.”</p>

<p>The boys, making the motor boat fast to the
sailing vessel with the rope, waited for a hail from
those they supposed to be aboard. But a silence
ensued after the noise of the collision and the throbbing
of the motor died away. All that could be
heard was the sound of the wind in the trees, birds
singing in the woods, and the lap of little waves
against the sides of the boats.</p>

<p>“Queer,” muttered Jerry, “I thought that
would arouse them. Must be sound asleep.
Here goes for another.”</p>

<p>He pushed the <i>Dartaway</i> back from the side of
the schooner and then, holding to the rope pulled
her forward again so that the nose of the motor
craft hit the sailing vessel a resounding blow.
Still there was silence on the <i>Bluebird</i>.</p>

<p>The boys waited for several minutes, listening
intently, but there was no sign of life other than
on their craft.</p>

<p>“I’m going aboard the schooner,” said Jerry at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think it’s safe?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” replied Jerry. “There
doesn’t seem to be any one in her. Maybe they’ve
only gone away for a little while, but it’s our best
chance. So here goes.”</p>

<p>With that he scrambled up the rope hand over
hand, and soon stood on the schooner’s deck.</p>

<p>“Come on up,” he called to Ned and Bob.
“The schooner is deserted!”</p>

<p>Up came the other two boys. They found the
hatches tightly closed, and, as the day was hot,
they reasoned that no one would be below with
all the openings shut. The schooner was in good
order, everything on deck being neatly arranged,
and showing that those who had deserted her had
not gone off in any haste. The vessel was moored
to shore with bow and stern lines.</p>

<p>“Well, now that we have things to ourselves,”
said Jerry, “let’s see what we can find. It ought
to be an easy matter to get below.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we have any right to,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” came from Ned. “We
suspect that some things from my father’s store are
here. If we take a look and don’t do any damage
where’s the harm. The thieves ought to be caught,
and we may get a clue to them in this way.”</p>

<p>“I say, let’s go below,” put in Jerry. “Try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
all the hatches. Maybe some of them are not
locked.”</p>

<p>Whoever had deserted the schooner had evidently
not felt any alarm about leaving their property
without the protection of lock and key, for
the first hatch cover the boys tried slid back easily,
disclosing a rather dark and steep companionway.</p>

<p>“Who’s going ahead?” asked Jerry. “Don’t
all speak at once.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s hesitancy on the part of
all three. There was no telling what they might
meet with, or who might be below.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Ned. “I don’t believe
any one’s there. I’ll make a break.”</p>

<p>He started down the companion steps, and,
after a second, Bob and Jerry followed.</p>

<p>“It’s as dark as a pocket!” said Bob. “I wish
we had a lantern.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” called Bob who was in the rear.
“I have a candle-end in my pocket.”</p>

<p>He brought it forth and lighted it, sending a
rather faint illumination through the cabin in which
the boys found themselves. No one was to be
seen, but, as was the case on deck, everything was
neatly in place, and no disorder evident.</p>

<p>“Now for the search!” exclaimed Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
“We’ll see if that tramp knew what he was writing
about with his funny message.”</p>

<p>Around the cabin were several lockers. These
the boys opened in succession, only to find them
empty. Clearly the booty, if it was aboard, was
not in this part of the vessel.</p>

<p>But there were many other places to search.
The craft was not a large one, but there was a
forecastle, and a small hold amidships. The boys
decided to try the hold first. To get into it they
found they would have to slide back the deck
hatch, and then lower themselves into the black
hole by means of a rope which hung from the
gaff, and which was evidently used to hoist cargo
in or out of the schooner.</p>

<p>With the hatches open the dark hole was made
lighter but at best it was not a pleasant place. Still
the boys were determined to explore it. Seeing
that the rope was securely fastened to the gaff,
Jerry swung himself over the hatchway, and went
down hand over hand. It was about ten feet from
the deck to the bottom. Bob and Ned followed.</p>

<p>In his descent Bob dropped the candle, which,
after burning a little while on the bottom of the
hold, went out.</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” said Jerry. “Don’t move now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
until we get a light. No telling what sort of a
hole you may fall into. Stay under the patch of
sunshine.”</p>

<p>The boys remained immediately under the hatchway
until Jerry, groping around, had found the
candle end and lighted it. Then the boys peered
around them, Jerry holding the tallow illuminator
above his head.</p>

<p>“Forward!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>The next instant there sounded a scurrying as if
some one was running about the hold.</p>

<p>“Some one’s coming!” cried Bob. “Come
on! They’re after us!”</p>

<p>The noise increased, and Jerry and Ned peered
forward expecting to see some one approaching out
of the darkness. Then came a series of shrill
cries.</p>

<p>“Rats!” exclaimed Jerry with a laugh. “I
forgot that all vessels are full of them.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked Bob, who had grabbed
hold of the rope.</p>

<p>“Sure; can’t you see them?” asked Jerry, and,
moving his candle back and forth close to the floor,
he pointed out where several big gray rodents were
huddled in one corner.</p>

<p>“Only rats, eh,” muttered Bob. “Well I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
wouldn’t want a lot of them to get after me.
They’re as big as cats.”</p>

<p>But the animals were probably more frightened
than Bob had been, for the next instant they all
disappeared down some hole. The boys began a
systematic search of the hold of the vessel. It did
not take long to show that no booty was contained
in it, unless, as Ned suggested, there was a secret
hiding place.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll try the fo’castle now,” said Jerry
as he blew out the candle to save it, and ascended
the rope. Bob and Ned followed.</p>

<p>By opening bull’s-eyes in the forecastle the place
was made light enough to see fairly well in.
There were several bunks, and a small table which
could be folded against the side out of the way.
The bunks were provided with bed clothes, and
a hasty examination of them showed nothing to be
hidden among them. The whole place was well
looked through, but there was no sign of the goods
stolen from Mr. Slade’s store.</p>

<p>“I guess that tramp must have had a dream,”
said Ned, “or else he wanted to write some
poetry.”</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” admitted Jerry, who was
idly looking at a figure of Neptune carved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
middle of a panel on the forward bulkhead.
“Still I don’t believe&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what Jerry believed he did not state, for,
the next instant he nearly fell as the panel containing
the representation of the sea god slid back and
disclosed a dark opening.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;” exclaimed Jerry recovering
his balance with difficulty. “This is queer. I was
just pressing on the trident when all of a sudden&mdash;it
happened.”</p>

<p>“Well I guess it did!” cried Ned. “I’ll bet
it’s the secret hiding place. Come on, let’s have
a look!”</p>

<p>“Light the candle!” said Jerry. “It’s as dark
as two pockets.”</p>

<p>In the gleam of the light there was disclosed a
place about five feet square, which had been built
forward of the forecastle bulkhead.</p>

<p>“Now for the stolen stuff!” cried Ned, as he
stepped inside. He flashed the candle around, but
it took only an instant to show that there was nothing
in the secret hiding place so opportunely discovered
by Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well of all the&mdash;” began Ned, when he suddenly
made a grab into one of the corners. “This
looks like something!” he went on. “Let me
get to the light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped into the forecastle and held up to
the view of his comrades a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“A piece of red silk!” exclaimed Ned. “It’s
just like some that was stolen from my father’s
store! The things have been here, but they are
gone!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are here yet,” suggested Jerry,
“only we can’t find them. Maybe there are
other secret hiding places. What had we better
do?”</p>

<p>The boys were much excited over their find.
That they were on the trail of the thieves they were
certain, but what to do next puzzled them.</p>

<p>“How would it do for one of us to stay here,
and the others go and get police assistance,” suggested
Ned. “We ought to have the detectives
on this case at once.”</p>

<p>“I have a better plan,” said Jerry. “Let two
of us stay here, and the other take the motor boat
and go after Chief Dalton in Cresville.”</p>

<p>“How will we decide who are to stay and who
is to go?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll draw lots,” replied Jerry. “Those
who get the longest will stay on the schooner, and
the one who gets the shortest will start in the motor
boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The lots were made from three straws. Jerry
got the shortest.</p>

<p>“Well, the sooner I get off the quicker the chief
will be back here,” he observed.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” put in Bob. “Have you
figured how long we’ll have to stay here, and not a
thing to eat? You can’t get back here before this
time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry, for once forgetting
to laugh at Bob’s concern over the food question.
“I’ll tell you what we’ll do. We’ll run
back to camp and bring enough stuff here to last
until I come back.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Ned. “Only there’s no use
in us all going. I’ll stay here, while you and Bob
go back to camp. Bring some lanterns, and some
cold victuals. Maybe we can find some food on
board. We certainly can make coffee for there’s
a stove in the galley, and I saw a coffee pot. All
we need is some coffee.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. Jerry and Bob made a
fast run to Deer Island, and were soon back to
the schooner with enough provisions to last the
two boys a day or more. In the meanwhile Ned
had been all over the schooner, but had made no
new discoveries.</p>

<p>He had found a good supply of canned goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and even some coffee, so there was no danger of
starving even if the victuals Jerry and Bob
brought gave out. The bunks were clean and
there was plenty of clothing, though it would
hardly be needed for the nights were warm.</p>

<p>It was now getting dusk and, after seeing that
his boat was in good shape Jerry prepared for the
long run back to Cresville.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourselves,” said he. “Keep a
good watch and if Noddy and the gang come back,
don’t run any chances. They’re desperate men,
and it would be better to retreat than run the chance
of a fight. If I were you I’d sleep in the cabin or
on deck in hammocks. I’ll come back as soon as
I can.”</p>

<p>“Better tell the chief to bring a couple of men
along,” said Ned. “No telling what may turn
up.”</p>

<p>“All right,” called back Jerry, as he headed the
<i>Dartaway</i> through the narrow channel and started
on the course to Cresville.</p>

<small>NED AND BOB CAPTURED</small></h2>


<p>It was a little lonesome for the two boys after
Jerry had gone. For as long as possible they
listened to the exhaust from the motor boat.
When that died away, and silence, broken only
by the lap of the water, and the occasional note of
a bird getting ready to seek its nest for the night,
settled down, that part of the lake was not the most
pleasant place in the world.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have supper, go to bed, and it
won’t seem so long,” said Bob. “I wish this robbery
business was all cleared up. I’m afraid something
may happen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re getting nervous,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I am,” admitted Bob, “but I
can’t help feeling that something is going to happen.”</p>

<p>After a simple but substantial meal the boys
brought some blankets up from the bunks and
made beds on the deck, in the shelter of the awning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which stretched from the forecastle to the
galley amidships. They were not long in falling
asleep, as they were worn out by the events of the
day, as well as being rendered drowsy by the open
air and wind.</p>

<p>It was about an hour past midnight when there
echoed over the lake, in the vicinity of the island
near which the schooner was hidden, the muffled
throbbing of a motor boat. It was not speeding,
as could be told by the intervals between the explosions.
Sometimes they died away altogether,
and silence ensued.</p>

<p>It was in one of these intervals, which betokened
that the engine had stopped and that those in the
boat were listening intently, that some one in the
craft dropped an object that awoke the echoes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter back there?” exclaimed a
harsh voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Noddy dropped his gun butt,” some one
replied.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, Bill, honest I couldn’t,”
whined Noddy. “It slipped out of my hand.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet!” exclaimed the one who had first
spoken. “If you don’t know how to handle a
gun let it alone. Then keep still. Do you want
to bring the whole lake down on us? Above
all, don’t yell out names like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll be careful,” said Noddy in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“It’s so fearful dark I can’t see where the
channel is,” said the man who was steering the
motor boat. The craft, which was a large one,
held five men, besides Noddy Nixon, who, if he
had been kidnapped by the “River Pirates,”
seemed to enjoy being in their company.</p>

<p>If Ned and Bob had been on watch they would
have seen, coming over the water toward the sailing
vessel a small dark object. They would have
heard the throb of the motor in the boat, which
was more plain, now that it was in the open.
But they were both, snoring away, blissfully
unconscious that their enemies were so close at
hand.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the boat, the man in
the bow watching with eagle eyes as the schooner
loomed out from the dark shadows of the woods.</p>

<p>“Any signs of anything suspicious?” asked Bill
Berry, who stood near Noddy.</p>

<p>“Not as I can see,” came the whispered answer.
“But we’ll take no chances. I’ll stop the
engine now and we can row up the rest of the
way. Then we’ll go aboard cautiously.”</p>

<p>Propelled by the oars, which were kept aboard
the motor boat in case of emergencies, the craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
made scarcely a sound as it slipped through the
water. A few minutes later it slid alongside the
schooner.</p>

<p>“Hold her steady,” said the man in the bow.
“I’ll go up the ladder and see if the coast is
clear.”</p>

<p>Over the side he stepped, dropping softly to
the deck. Then every sense on the alert he moved
forward. As he came around the galley he dimly
saw, stretched out under the awning, the sleeping
boys.</p>

<p>He listened a moment, and then softly crept
nearer. Now he could hear the heavy breathing
of the sleepers that told they were soundly slumbering.</p>

<p>“I’m going to chance it,” the man said softly
to himself. “I’ve got to know who they are.”</p>

<p>He struck a match and, shading the flame with
his hands, held it as close as he dared to the sleeping
ones. At once the man started back with a
half-smothered exclamation.</p>

<p>“Two of the boys!” he muttered. “They
found us after all, and are on guard. Lucky for
us they’re asleep. What shall we do?”</p>

<p>It did not take the man long to make up his
mind. He went softly to the side of the schooner,
and was soon back in the motor boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Paxton, what’s the verdict?” asked
Bill Berry. “Any one aboard?”</p>

<p>“Softly!” exclaimed Paxton. “We’ve got
our work cut out for us. Two of those boys are
asleep on deck. Now here’s my plan.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get out while we have the
chance?” asked one of the gang. “This game
is getting too hot. There may be only two boys
asleep on deck, but who knows but what there are
some police in the cabin?”</p>

<p>“With the hatches shut on this hot night?”
asked Paxton. “I guess not. I’m sure there are
only the two lads, and we’ve got ’em just where
we want ’em.”</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“We’re going to tow the schooner away from
here,” replied Paxton. “Look lively now. Some
of you go ashore, and cast off the lines. We’ll
need ’em for a tow rope.”</p>

<p>“What about the boys?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“We’re going to take ’em along with us,” replied
Paxton. “If they walk into the spider’s web
they can’t complain if the spider eats ’em. Lively
now, but walk as though you were treading on
eggs.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes two men who went ashore,
the motor boat having been moved so they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
easily land, had cast off the ropes. Then they
were unbent from the cleats, and reeved together
to make a long tow line. One end of this was
fastened to a capstan in the bow, and the other
to bitts in the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Now if you’re all ready go ahead,” said Paxton
in a whisper to his crew. “I’m going to stay
aboard the schooner to attend to the boys when
they wake up. Bill, you’d better steer. Pull the
schooner right out into the middle of the lake.
If they raise a row there it can’t be heard.”</p>

<p>The motor boat was worked around, by means
of the oars until it was in the narrow channel
through which the schooner had come. Then it
was propelled ahead by the same means until the
tow rope was almost taut. This was done so that
when the engine was started the noise of the explosions
might be farther away, and so less likely
to wake up the sleepers.</p>

<p>Waiting aboard the sailing craft, Paxton heard
the distant sound of the motor getting into action.
Then the rope stretched out, and the schooner
began moving slowly through the water. As it
gathered headway, Paxton went to the wheel and
kept her on the course, taking sight by means of
a lantern he had directed Bill Berry to place on
the stern of the motor craft. In ten minutes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
schooner was well out on the lake, which at that
late hour, or rather early one, for it was about
three o’clock in the morning, was deserted.</p>

<p>Leaning against the wheel Paxton filled his pipe
with tobacco and applied a match. It was drawing
good, and he was beginning to feel more
comfortable in spite of the cold and the hard
work he had done that night, when one of the
sleepers stirred.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have a scene now,” muttered
Paxton, as he lashed the wheel to keep the
schooner on a straight course down the lake, in
which direction the motor boat was towing it.
A second later Bob sat up.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed. “What’s up. I say,
Ned, wake up! We’re adrift!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Ned, rubbing his eyes,
and jumping to his feet. “Adrift? Why so
we are. We’re out in the middle of the lake.”</p>

<p>It was getting a little lighter and the mist was
lifting somewhat.</p>

<p>“In the middle of the lake?” repeated Bob
in bewilderment as he too got on his feet and
stood beside Ned. “Why I didn’t know there
was current enough in the lake to carry us this
far out.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t!” exclaimed Ned. “There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
something wrong here. Hark! Isn’t that a motor
boat?”</p>

<p>The faint throb of the craft towing the schooner
could be heard.</p>

<p>“It is, sure enough,” came from Bob. “Can’t
be Jerry back already.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t Jerry,” spoke Paxton, from where
he stood at the wheel, being somewhat hidden
from the sight of the boys. “It’s some friends
of mine.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Ned, walking in the
direction of the voice.</p>

<p>“Never mind who I am,” replied the man.
“You’ll learn soon enough. But first you’ll have
to learn a little bit about how we do things aboard
ship. So stop just where you are, young man. If
you come any nearer it might be dangerous for
you. This part of the vessel is sacred to the
captain and his friends. For the present you represent
the crew, and the crew’s place is forward.</p>

<p>“So just march over to the fo’castle, and stay
there until I tell you to come aft. Take your
beds with you, if you like, and bunk there.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be running things with a pretty
high hand,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ve got a right to. This is
my ship. I didn’t invite you to come aboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
But now you’re here you may not find it so easy
to get away. I may like your company.”</p>

<p>“Are you aware that we have proof that you
and your gang was concerned in the robbery of
my father’s store?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m not good at answering riddles,” replied
Paxton, composedly smoking away. “Now you
do as I say before I get mad and cause you
trouble.”</p>

<p>The schooner was now well out in the middle
of the lake. It was getting quite light, but the boys
could see no help at hand. The motor boat was
steadily towing away.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Bob of Ned, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything but to do as we’re told,”
answered Ned. “No chance of help now.”</p>

<p>They moved forward. At that moment Paxton
placed his fingers to his lips and gave a shrill
whistle.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the motor boat was alongside
the sailing vessel. Bill Berry and another
man scrambled aboard.</p>

<p>“Help me tie up these lads,” said Paxton.
“Then we’ll take them aboard the motor craft.
When that’s done start towing again.”</p>

<p>For an instant Bob and Ned had a wild thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of resisting the gang, or at least jumping overboard
and swimming to escape. But a moment’s
reflection showed how futile this would be.</p>

<p>Believing discretion the better part of valor
at that time, they submitted quietly while the three
men bound their arms. Then they were led to
the side, helped over and were soon seated in the
stern of the motor boat.</p>

<p>Paxton and Bill Berry remained on board the
schooner, and were joined by Noddy, who said
he did not want to stay in the smaller craft. Then,
as the sun was peeping up over the distant hills,
the towing was resumed, the schooner being pulled
directly up the lake, and approaching the western
shore in a long curve. Bob and Ned were in the
hands of their enemies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>JERRY’S RETURN</small></h2>


<p>Jerry’s voyage to the head of the lake and
then up the river was without incident. It was
rather a lonely trip, but he had no time to feel any
alarm.</p>

<p>He arrived at Cresville early the next morning
and left the boat at the private dock, while he
hurried to acquaint the chief of police and Mr.
Slade with the news about the schooner.</p>

<p>Jerry found the chief had not yet come down
to headquarters, and, not caring to tell the sergeant
in charge his errand, he went to Mr. Slade’s house.</p>

<p>“What’s this? Oh it’s you, Jerry, eh? No
bad news I hope? None of you boys drowned
at the lake? What’s the trouble? You look as
if you’d had a tussle with a bull and came out
second best,” said Ned’s father.</p>

<p>Jerry told his story and also related their plans.</p>

<p>“Good idea!” exclaimed Mr. Slade. “We’ll
go and see the chief at once.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton had arrived by the time they got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to headquarters and called Mr. Slade and Jerry
into his private room. There Jerry told the story
over again, to the no small astonishment of the
police official.</p>

<p>He gave several orders over the telephone, including
one to have the motor boat <i>Terror</i> made
ready at once for a long trip.</p>

<p>Jerry found he would have about an hour to
wait before the start back could be made, so he
went to his home and also Bob’s and told the
folks the camping party was all well. He said
nothing of the discoveries, for fear of alarming
his mother and Bob’s parents.</p>

<p>The chief and two detectives made up the police
posse. They went to the dock where the <i>Terror</i>
was tied up and got aboard. Mr. Slade had
counted on going, but, at the last moment, found
some business affairs needed his attention.</p>

<p>As soon as Jerry found the chief and his men
were about to start he hurried back to the <i>Dartaway’s</i>
boat house and made ready for his return
trip. He found the engine needed some slight
adjustments, and quickly made them.</p>

<p>While he was bending over the cylinders, putting
in some new spark plugs, he heard a step
behind, and Andy Rush joined him.</p>

<p>“Are you going on another trip?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, want to come along?” asked Jerry, for
he liked Andy, in spite of the galvanic battery
action of the younger lad.</p>

<p>“Say! Do I!”</p>

<p>“Jump in,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>Jerry looked over the engine to see that it was
in good order. He filled the auxiliary gasolene
tank, took aboard some extra batteries and other
supplies and announced he was ready to start.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if we can’t catch the <i>Terror</i>,” he
remarked, having told Andy something of the
plans afoot.</p>

<p>Jerry cranked up the motor. It throbbed and
roared and he was about to throw in the clutch
and send the boat off when some one hailed
him.</p>

<p>“I say, fair sir. Wilt take a poor wayfarer
aboard? I fain must be on my way, and my
coach seems to have passed me by.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked up. Down the dock was approaching
a ragged figure; a man clothed in old garments
that flapped about him. The mere remnant of
a hat completed his attire.</p>

<p>“It’s the tramp!” Jerry exclaimed under his
breath. “If he doesn’t turn up at the oddest
times. I wonder what his secret is.”</p>

<p>“May I come aboard?” asked the ragged man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t let him. Maybe he’s one of the
thieves,” objected Andy in a low tone.</p>

<p>But Jerry had different ideas. He wanted, if
possible, to learn more about the tramp. He felt
that the man had a secret, and that it concerned
the robbery, and some other queer happenings of
late, Jerry was most certain.</p>

<p>“Wilt take an humble passenger?” the tramp
asked again, seeing that Jerry seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, your Majesty, if you wilt be
pleased to accept such mean transportation as your
slave is able to offer you,” replied Jerry with a
smile, determining to enter into the tramp’s humor.</p>

<p>Past Cresville they went, and by noon they had
caught up to the <i>Terror</i>, for the chief had ordered
her run slowly, as he wanted to see Jerry. The
presence of the tramp excited no comment from
Mr. Dalton. On the contrary Jerry was almost
sure he saw some secret sign pass between the chief
of police and the ragged man. This, more than
ever, made him curious to get at the bottom of
the strange fellow’s secret.</p>

<p>It was decided to go ashore for dinner at a
small town which the boats reached about one
o’clock. The craft were tied up at the dock, and
when Jerry and Andy left the <i>Dartaway</i>, the tramp
remained behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry asked if the chief knew the man at all.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve seen him around,” Mr. Dalton replied.
“He’s an odd character. But never mind
him. Where do you expect we’ll pick up the
boys?”</p>

<p>“Right aboard the schooner at the island,”
answered Jerry, wondering why the chief changed
the subject so suddenly.</p>

<p>The journey was resumed after the meal and
about four o’clock the boats emerged from the
river upon the lake.</p>

<p>“Now for the schooner!” exclaimed Jerry as
his boat swung ahead, it having been agreed that
he should lead the way. The <i>Terror</i> was close
behind.</p>

<p>Several miles had been covered, when the tramp,
who had not spoken for some time, exclaimed,
stretching out his hand:</p>

<p>“I think there’s your schooner!”</p>

<p>“We’re nowhere near the place,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find I’m right,” the ragged
man went on. “I guess something has happened
and the schooner has moved. I see her masts
sticking up from behind those trees.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jerry rounded the point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
There, in full view of the setting sun, was the
schooner. There could be no mistaking her.</p>

<p>He steered his boat up to the sailing craft.
There seemed to be no sign of life aboard.</p>

<p>“Ahoy <i>Bluebird</i>!” called Jerry.</p>

<p>He had stopped his engine, and the chief had
done the same for the <i>Terror</i>. Amid a deep
silence they waited for an answer to the hail.
None came.</p>

<p>Then, as the motor boats drifted alongside the
schooner, it could be seen that she was tied to
the shore and deserted.</p>

<p>“Where are Ned and Bob?” asked Jerry, a
nameless terror tugging at his heart.</p>

<small>THE CHASE</small></h2>


<p>“Humph! This is strange!” the chief exclaimed
as his boat swung up alongside of the
<i>Dartaway</i>. “Let’s go aboard.”</p>

<p>Making the motor craft fast, they all scrambled
up and were soon on the schooner’s deck.</p>

<p>A hasty search served to show that the schooner
had no occupants.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” said Jerry, who was
much alarmed.</p>

<p>From the shore, where the tramp had gone,
leaping from the schooner’s deck, there came an
excited shout.</p>

<p>“Here’s a clue!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the chief as he prepared
to join the ragged man.</p>

<p>For answer the tramp pointed to several footprints
in the soft sand near the edge of the lake.</p>

<p>“The man with the arrow on his shoe!” he
said. “I thought we’d find him with the gang.
Now, Chief, I guess we can close in on ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry and the two detectives had gone ashore
by this time. They observed several footprints,
indicating that a number of men had been tramping
around near where the schooner was moored to the
bank. Probably they had been engaged in making
the craft fast.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the boys were here also,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks very possible,” said the tramp. “Here
are the mark of feet smaller than those of men.
Did Bob or Ned have any peculiar nail marks
in their shoes?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, the chances are if they were not here
on shore they were in some boat the rascals had,”
the tramp went on.</p>

<p>“You think they must have had some other
boat than the schooner?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>“I’m certain of it,” the ragged man replied.
“How else could the schooner have gotten here?
There wasn’t enough wind all night to move a
canoe, let alone a heavy schooner. Yet we find
this vessel several miles from where Jerry left
her. The thieves must have had a power boat,
gone back after their craft and towed her. Now
I don’t see any use lingering here. They’ve got
a good start of us, but maybe we can catch them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where shall we look?” the chief asked.
“Up or down the lake; or follow the river?”</p>

<p>“Follow the river,” the tramp said. “I’ll
round these fellows up now. We’ll land ’em at
the cave if not before.”</p>

<p>Jerry wondered at the tramp’s manner. He
seemed to have assumed control of matters, and
to be directing the hunt after the thieves.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Jerry asked of the chief.</p>

<p>The tramp overheard the lad’s question.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell him?” the odd character asked.
“I guess we’ve kept up the mystery long enough,
Chief, and we’re pretty near the end of the affair
now.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” spoke Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p>“So you think there’s something queer about
me, do you?” the tramp asked Jerry, who nodded
in assent. “Well, I admit I am not what I seem.
Allow me to make you acquainted with the Duke
of Wellington, otherwise known as Detective
Sergeant Layton, of New York,” he went on with
an elaborate bow and an assumption of his former
grand manners.</p>

<p>“A detective!” exclaimed Jerry. “Well I
had my suspicions all along that you were something
like that, but I couldn’t see what you were
after.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m after these thieves,” replied Detective
Layton. “From the time you rescued me from
the hay barge I’ve been on their trail, first here,
then there, often in this disguise, and now I think
I am about to close in. The chase started in New
York, where they committed a series of daring
robberies in department stores. For a while I
lost track of them. Then I heard they were in
this section and I came here. They kept quiet
for some time and I thought I had lost them.
Then I got on the track of Bill Berry and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is Noddy Nixon mixed up in this robbery?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but I don’t believe he is,” replied
Mr. Layton. “I think he is with the gang instead
of being kidnapped, but I believe he is more a
tool in the hands of designing men than an actual
criminal himself. However, we’ll soon see.</p>

<p>“The time the thieves took your motor boat
I was after them, but they gave us the slip as you
saw. However, I managed to locate a cave where
I am sure they have their headquarters.”</p>

<p>“All ready, then!” exclaimed the chief.
“We’ll speed the boats up after the scoundrels!”</p>

<p>“Going to make it a night affair?” asked one
of the Cresville detectives. “It’ll soon be so dark
we can’t see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Layton. “We’ll
make a start, and tie up long enough for supper.
Then we can go on all night. It will not do to
lose any time. Have we any provisions?”</p>

<p>“We can stop at our camp and get some,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>This plan was carried out, and, in a short time,
both boats having been well stocked, the craft
puffed away toward where the river flowed into
the lake.</p>

<p>While the preparations of the police for capturing
the thieves were going on, the fellows themselves
had not been idle. Once Ned and Bob
were aboard the motor boat, and the towing of
the schooner was resumed, the robbers followed
a well-laid-out plan.</p>

<p>The schooner was taken to the little cove where
she was hidden behind the trees. Then, those
who had been aboard her, getting into the motor
boat, the flight began.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned were gagged to prevent them giving
any alarm when other boats were passed, and
they were bidden to lie at full length on the
cushions in the small open cabin of the craft, so
they could not be seen. Paxton put one of the
gang to keep watch over the boys while he attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to the steering of the boat. Another was
kept at the engine to see that it ran properly, and
Noddy Nixon and Bill Berry were left to their
own devices.</p>

<p>All that morning the motor boat was speeded
up the river. About noon the boys could see,
from the surrounding country that they were nearing
Cresville. This fact seemed to be apparent
to Paxton and his gang. He steered the boat
close to shore and tied up in the shadow of some
bushes. There a rude meal was prepared, and
the two captives were allowed to eat a little. They
expected to see the boat start up again after dinner,
but this was not Paxton’s plan.</p>

<p>He realized to go past Cresville in daylight
might result in the discovery of the two boys, and,
though he knew his craft was a swift one, he did
not want any pursuit.</p>

<p>Accordingly he held the boat in its hiding place
until dusk. Thus it happened that Jerry and Chief
Dalton, in their craft, on their journey down the
river had passed the boat in which the thieves
and their captives were.</p>

<p>It was after dark when Paxton gave the order
to start, and the motor craft slipped past Cresville
about ten o’clock. A little while before this the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
<i>Dartaway</i> and <i>Terror</i> had taken up the pursuit on
Cantoga Lake, starting in the race more than a
score of miles behind.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned, though they had kept their spirits
up bravely were almost in despair. Their jaws
ached from the strain of the gags, and their bodies
were tired from lying in one position so long.</p>

<p>Through the long night the flight continued.
Past village after village the thieves and their
captives sped.</p>

<p>Behind them, though they did not know it,
came the pursuers in the <i>Terror</i> and <i>Dartaway</i>.
The two boats were making good time, but were
far in the rear. It was early dawn when the
forces of the chief, and Jerry in his craft, which
also contained Andy Rush and Detective Layton,
passed Cresville.</p>

<p>“I wonder how far they are ahead,” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ll make some inquiries of persons ashore,
as soon as it gets light enough,” the tramp-detective
said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>About seven o’clock the two pursuing boats
were about ten miles above Cresville. They made
a short stop at a little village and coffee was prepared.
While the simple breakfast was being gotten
ready the chief and Detective Layton went
ashore. They learned from a man who kept a
boathouse that a large motor craft had gone up
the river about four o’clock that morning. He
said he had seen it when he came down to go out
on a short fishing trip.</p>

<p>“Three hours ahead of us,” said Mr. Layton.
“Well, if they only have some sort of an accident
we might catch them. If not, we’ll have to trail
them to the cave.”</p>

<p>Jerry, who had not been asleep during the past
two nights, save for a brief nap or two, was almost
exhausted. Seeing his condition Mr. Layton
offered to steer the <i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jerry. “But wake me up
the moment you sight the other boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>About two o’clock the pursuing boats swung out
into a long straight stretch of the river.</p>

<p>“We’re getting pretty close now,” the tramp-detective
called to the chief. “About five miles
up is where they left the boat the other time and
took to the cave. I wish we could sight ’em now.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” the chief replied. “Say,” he
went on, standing up and pointing ahead, “doesn’t
that look like some sort of a boat?”</p>

<p>“It sure does,” Mr. Layton replied. “Wait
a minute.”</p>

<p>Holding the wheel steady with his knees he
drew from his pocket a small telescope. Adjusting
it, he peered forward and looked steadily
through it for several seconds.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s them!” he exclaimed. “I can’t
make out the figures very well, but it’s a big motor
boat, and one I’ve not seen around here before.
They seem to be having some trouble aboard.
Maybe the engine has broken down.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so,” the chief said. “If it only
stays broken until we catch up!”</p>

<p>The <i>Terror</i> and <i>Dartaway</i> were making good
time against the current. Nearer and nearer they
came to the other boat. When within a mile of
her Mr. Layton could make out the occupants
quite clearly through his glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“There they are!” he cried. “And whatever
was the matter with the engine they’ve got it
fixed now for they’ve started up again.”</p>

<p>“Try and get a few more revolutions out of
your craft!” cried the chief. “Every inch tells.
I guess we can hit our engine up a bit more!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to wake up Jerry,” Detective Layton
said. “I don’t know enough about engines to
monkey with ’em.”</p>

<p>Jerry awoke as soon as he felt the detective’s
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Have we caught them?” he asked.</p>

<p>The detective pointed ahead.</p>

<p>“Can you get a little more speed up?” asked
the officer.</p>

<p>“We’ll have ’em pretty soon!” cried Jerry,
as he put the engine to the utmost limit.</p>

<p>The gang of thieves was now making frantic
efforts to escape. Several of the men were in the
stern, and they seemed to hold guns in their hands.</p>

<p>“Better lay low,” advised Mr. Layton.</p>

<p>At that instant a shot rang out from the boat
ahead.</p>

<p>“I guess they mean real business!” exclaimed
Andy Rush. “That sounded like a bullet.”</p>

<p>“It was,” Mr. Layton said, “but they fired
in the air to scare us. Go on, Jerry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Dartaway</i> was in the lead. Close behind
it, however, was the police craft. A short quarter
mile separated the pursuers from the pursued.</p>

<p>“They’re giving up!” cried Detective Layton.</p>

<p>A minute later the craft ahead had run ashore.
Out of her piled several men and Noddy Nixon.
They set off on a run across the meadows which
at that point bordered the river.</p>

<p>“Where are Bob and Ned?” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“They’re probably tied in the boat!” yelled
Mr. Layton. “You look after them. The chief
and I will see to the thieves!”</p>

<p>Jerry steered the <i>Dartaway</i> close to where the
disabled boat was poking her nose into a mud
bank. As soon as it was near enough to shore
Mr. Layton leaped for the bank. He was followed
by Chief Dalton and his men, who went
off on the run after the thieves.</p>

<p>Jerry shut off the power and then leaped into
the other boat. He saw Bob and Ned lying bound
on the seats.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he cried, but the boys could
not answer because of the gags. Jerry saw what
the trouble was and cut them. Then he released
his friends, and with Andy Rush, chaffed their
hands, which were numb from lack of circulation,
caused by the tight ropes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you all right?” asked Jerry, when he
saw Bob and Ned could stand up.</p>

<p>“Well I guess so!” exclaimed Bob, speaking
for the first time in several hours. “Have you
got anything to eat, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Say, if you were to be blown up in a powder
mill, I believe the first thing you’d ask for when
you came down would be a sandwich,” exclaimed
Ned. “But go ahead, Jerry, get him something
to eat, and then tell us how it all happened.”</p>

<p>“Come over on our boat,” advised Jerry.
“We’ve got lots to eat there.”</p>

<p>While Ned and Bob were partaking of food
Jerry quickly told of what had happened. In turn
the boys related their experience, and how, at the
last moment the engine of the thieves’ boat gave
out, which lucky chance led to their being overtaken
by the pursuers.</p>

<p>“I hope they catch the thieves,” said Ned.
“They’re a bad gang.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care what happens as long as
you and Bob are all right,” Jerry replied.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged all the details since the
parting at the place where the schooner was
moored, and were going over some events for
the second time when they heard a sound as of
some persons approaching. A few seconds later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
there appeared at the edge of the river Chief
Dalton, Detective Layton, and the two Cresville
officers. Each one held a captive by the arm, and
the wrists of the captured ones were enclosed in
irons.</p>

<p>“Did you land ’em?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We sure did!” cried the tramp-detective.</p>

<p>“Got ’em just as they were going to barricade
the cave. Nabbed ’em without a shot being fired,
and got possession of a lot of plunder too.”</p>

<p>“Is the stuff from my father’s store there?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and from half a dozen other stores,”
replied the detective. “It’s the biggest round-up
of thieves in a good while, and you boys deserve
credit for your part.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Noddy?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, he and Bill Berry got away,” said Chief
Dalton. “But we don’t mind. We got the principal
ones. Noddy was not mixed up in the thefts.
He only helped the men, and I guess they bled him
for money. Bill Berry we’d like to have, but
we’ll get him later. Now for home.”</p>

<p>The captives were taken aboard the police boat.
Some of the more valuable of the plunder was
placed on the <i>Dartaway</i>, and the rest was left in
charge of one of the detectives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sensation that lasted for several
days when the motor boys got back to Cresville
and the affair became known. There were stories
in the newspapers, not only in the town where they
lived, but in the New York journals. The boys
were complimented on all sides for the parts they
had played.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade recovered nearly all of his stuff and
the money taken was found buried in the cave. He
divided the reward among the boys and the police.
Several other store proprietors in nearby towns,
and in New York, received goods that had been
stolen from them. The schooner, it developed,
had often made the voyage between New York and
Cresville.</p>

<p>The thieves were tried and convicted, being sentenced
to long terms in prison.</p>

<p>As for Noddy, he was not found for nearly a
month after the sensational capture. Then one of
the Cresville detectives, who was working on a
chicken stealing case, found him in the old hut, near
which the boys had once picked up Noddy’s knife.
It developed that he had run away after the arrest
of the thieves, and had been living as best he could,
traveling about the country doing odd jobs. He
was brought back home, but was not arrested, as
there was no charge against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish he’d stayed away,” remarked Jerry,
when he heard of Noddy’s return. “He’s a bad
sort of chap to have around.”</p>

<p>“Well I guess we’ve taught him not to interfere
with us,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“That kind never learns a lesson,” Jerry added.
“We’ll be bothered with Noddy as long as he’s
anywhere near us.”</p>

<p>And though he did not know it, Jerry spoke
with truth. For Noddy was smarting over what
had happened, and much ashamed of the disclosures
regarding his connection with the thieving gang.</p>

<p>The further trouble he and Bill Berry caused
the motor boys will be told of in another volume to
be called, “The Motor Boys on the Atlantic; Or,
The Mystery of the Lighthouse.”</p>

<p>But with the clearing up of the mystery of the
robbery, and the arrest of the gang the motor boys
were destined to have a period of quietness. They
went back to Lake Cantoga after matters in regard
to the trial of the thieves had been settled, and
enjoyed several days of life in the open.</p>

<p>There we will leave them for the present, having
a good time in their motor boat, which proved
to be all that they had hoped.</p>
